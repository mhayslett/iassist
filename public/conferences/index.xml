      <description>Program Planning Manual The purpose of this Handbook is to assist those who will be responsible for developing the program of future IASSIST Annual Conferences. The information contained within has been put together by several individuals who have had experience running past conferences. While many things necessarily change from year to year, there is a surprising amount of continuity involving the decisions made and the deadlines set. It is hoped this manual can be continued as a living document, dynamically maintained by succeeding generations of conference program planners.</description>

      <description>The International Association for Social Science Information Services &amp;amp; Technology (IASSIST) holds its conferences to enable its members to share research on, and innovations in, the social sciences data lifecycle, to receive continuing education and to build professional networks.
To provide all participants – members and other attendees, speakers, exhibitors, staff and volunteers – the opportunity to benefit from the event, IASSIST is dedicated to a positive, safe and harassment-free conference experience in which diverse participants may learn, network and enjoy the company of colleagues in an environment of mutual human respect and regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, religion or other group identity or political beliefs.</description>

Networking opportunities with peers from around the world take place in breakout groups, interest group or birds of a feather sessions, and perhaps most importantly, during the breaks.</description>
