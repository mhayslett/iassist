## Essays on How Different Countries View Race
IASSIST members have contributed essays or resources explaining how their respective nations have viewed or counted racial groups over time.  
Please note that the authors do not claim expertise as researchers in this area.  In most cases, they have cited the literature about these
issues or compiled documentation from their country's official statistics to describe how such counts were done.  If you would like to 
contribute an essay of your own for another country or a revision to one of these, please email the current chairs of the interest group.
