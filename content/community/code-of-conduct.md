The International Association for Social Science Information Service & Technology (IASSIST) brings together a diverse and vibrant community of data professionals to foster and promote a network of excellence for data service delivery, advance infrastructure in the social sciences, and provide opportunities for collegial exchange of sound professional practices. 

In order to maintain an environment, both physically and virtually, that optimizes the achievement of these goals by its members, IASSIST embraces equality, diversity, inclusion, anti-racism and is committed to a zero-tolerance policy towards any kind of discrimination or threatening behavior. Within this environment, our diverse participants may learn, network, and enjoy the company of colleagues in an environment of mutual respect and safety regardless of gender or sexual identity, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, national origin, language, religion, disability, physical appearance, or other group identity, educational or economic background, or political beliefs. 

English is the working language of IASSIST.  However, at any events and among the members, everyone should feel welcome despite which language(s) they natively speak.

We recognize a shared responsibility to create and actively support a harassment-free environment for the benefit of all. Harassment is any verbal or non-verbal behavior that threatens another person or group and that reinforces social structures of domination. 

All community members in all IASSIST events are requested to follow expected values stated above. The following is meant as a guideline and is not an exhaustive list of behaviors for the IASSIST community. 

## Language and Actions

### Appropriate
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions at community events.
Strive for collaboration over conflict.

### Inappropriate

Engage in unwarranted or rude behaviour that stifles or prevents participation by all.
Use intimidating, bullying, harassing, abusive, personally derogatory or demeaning speech or actions that indicate exclusion because of the person’s characteristics in-person or virtually. 

## Environment

### Appropriate

Participate in an authentic and active way, while respecting others’ physical and virtual space.
Use technology to participate in a constructive and respectful way that contributes to the well-being and development of the community.

### Inappropriate

Virtually or in-person posting, recording, photographing, or displaying sexualized, racist, violent, or otherwise discriminatory material (imagery or language). 
Physical or sexual assault, inappropriate and non-consensual physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention; including, deliberate intimidation or stalking/following physically or virtually. 

## Dealing with violations

Contact IASSIST leadership <email> if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Participants asked to stop a hostile or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Participants who violate this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled.
