The central purpose of the **IASSIST Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group** is to foster conversations regarding the needs of researchers who generate qualitative data, and what types of services librarians and other information professionals can develop to support these researchers in managing their data/source materials throughout the research lifecycle. Expected outcomes include

- developing a connected and informed group,
- providing opportunities for professional development through training, and
- collecting and creating tools and resources for all IASSIST members to make use of (both IG members and non-members).
