#### Accessing linked health data in a COVID-world: Whatâ€™s the state of play?

This webinar organized by the IASSIST professional development committee on 6/4 at 11:30 am (EDT). 

Speakers:
: Richard Welpton, The Health Foundation
: Deborah Wiltshire, UK Data Archive
: Sarah Young, Carnegie Mellon
: Eimmy Solis, University of Southern California

> The COVID-19 situation has understandably instigated a vast effort to research and analyse the effects of this virus on healthcare systems in the short-term; longer-term initiatives will seek to examine the wider effects on society. The availability of data, both health-specific, and linked to social science data, is challenging and reflects the issues with accessing and using health data that many researchers have experienced in the past. Sadly, we have been unable to meet in person at IASSIST 2020 in Gothenburg:  but instead, we are organising a seminar to invite interested IASSIST members who support researchers seeking access to health and linked health data to come and share their experiences of accessing health data generally; and in particular, how they are supporting researchers with access to data about COVID-19.
