## IASSIST Webinars

IASSIST Professional Developement Committee organizes and hosts IASSIST Community Webinars. Webinars are free to attend, but a registration is required. IASSIST members will be the first ones to get the information on future webinars. Webinars usually last about 45-60 minutes. Some of the topics have for example been data visualization, qualitative analysis tools, and data curation. 

Webinars will be recorded and made available on the IASSIST YouTube Channel.
