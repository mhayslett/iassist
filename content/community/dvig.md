### Data Visualization Interest Group (DVIG)

The IASSIST Data Visualization Interest Group will focus on promoting a greater understanding of data visualization â€“ its creation, uses, and importance in research, across disciplines. Data Visualization supports a means to make sense of data, through visual representation, and to communicate ideas and information effectively.

Particular areas of focus and discussions include, but are not limited to the following:

- Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance their skills in this growing field;
- Support a culture of best practice for data visualization techniques; creation, use, and curation;
- Discussion of the relevant tools (programs, web tools, and software) for all kinds of data visualizations (spatial, temporal, categorical, multivariate, graphing, networks, animation, etc.);
- Provide input and feedback on data visualization tools;
- Capture examples of data visualization to emulate and avoid;
- Explore opportunities for service development in libraries;
- Use of data visualization for allowing pre-analysis browsing of data content in repositories;
- Be aware of and communicate to others the needs of researchers in this field;
- Connect with communities of metadata developers and users (e.g., [DDI Alliance](https://ddialliance.org/) to gain better understanding of how metadata can enable better visualization, and how in turn visualization need might drive development of metadata standards.

We will seek out and take advantage of opportunities to learn, educate, and share expertise, including submitting proposals to organize sessions on data visualization for the 2014 IASSIST Annual Conference. We will explore and take advantage of opportunities to gather and disseminate relevant information and tools, visualizations, and resources for researchers and visualization creators alike.
