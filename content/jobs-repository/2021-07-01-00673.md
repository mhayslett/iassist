Washington, D.C. - Federal Reserve Board

**Job Title:** Librarian (Data and Subscriptions Licensing)

**Position Description:** This librarian position (part of the Board’s “Knowledge Analyst” job family) will join an experienced, customer-focused team of five librarians on the Board Research Library’s Data and Subscriptions Team who acquire data and subscription services that fuel the economic research at the Federal Reserve Board, the nation’s central bank. This librarian position blends reference skills needed to learn about economists’ data needs and acquisition skills to coordinate negotiations for new licenses and renewals of existing licenses. The Board Research Library has 18 staff supporting the research and policy work of more than 300 economists and hundreds of analysts. This position is particularly rewarding because the data and subscriptions we acquire are used immediately to brief Chair Powell, the Board of Governors, and Federal Reserve Bank presidents who chart the course of U.S. monetary policy.

**Responsibilities:**

- Evaluate the research needs of economists and analysts to connect them to existing data and research resources
- Interview researchers to gather specifications used as the basis to negotiate new data and subscription services licenses

- Answer questions from data managers and researchers about licensed data and connect them to data vendor subject matter experts
- Verify data citations in externally released publications to ensure data used complies with our license agreements

**Required Qualifications:**

- Master’s degree in library or information science from an ALA-accredited institution or degree in a related field or equivalent experience
- Minimum of 2-3 years of professional experience as a reference librarian or acquisitions librarian
- Basic knowledge of the process of contracting for library electronic resources such as data sets, online news, e-journal aggregators, or e-books.
- Ability to coordinate multiple project workflows simultaneously
- Strong verbal and written communication skills to build relationships with internal customers and external vendors
- Impeccable attention to detail needed to document the acquisitions process 

**Desired Qualifications:**

- Experience negotiating licenses for library electronic resources such as data sets, online news, e-journal aggregators, or e-books
- Subject matter knowledge in areas of business (such as economics, finance, banking, or accounting) is preferred but not required
- Basic knowledge of the federal government contracting process is helpful but not required

**Telework:** This role will require relocation to Washington, D.C. area after the Board ends its pandemic response, maximum telework status. Other flexible work arrangements are offered.
