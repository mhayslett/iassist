We are looking for two developers to join the DMPonline team. DMPonline is a world-leading service for data management planning, allowing researchers to create, share and update their plans for creating and sharing data used in research. It allows them to collaborate with research colleagues, professional support staff who can provide reviews and advice, and their research funders. We sell our service to over 50 research organisations and funders in Europe and elsewhere and have an active user group that provides input on feature development and integration with other research infrastructures.

You will be jointly responsible for support and technical development, working with other developer and customer support colleagues within the DCC, and helping with liaison with international contributors. The open-source DMPRoadmap code is developed in collaboration with colleagues at California Digital Library (https://uc3.cdlib.org/). 

The posts are full-time, 35 hours per week, open ended, with excellent staff benefits. Deadline for application is 5pm on 25 October 2021.
