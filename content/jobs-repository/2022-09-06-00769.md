Working within the School of Arts & Sciences, the Science Librarian develops innovative approaches to research, teaching, and learning. The Science Librarian provides instruction and research support for biology, chemistry, biochemistry & molecular biology, health studies, and physics. In addition, the Science Librarian collaborates with faculty from across the liaison areas to select, manage, and develop a diverse collection that reflects the current needs of the curriculum as well as anticipating future areas for growth.

Professional librarians hold faculty status. Faculty status allows both voice and vote in University faculty meetings, eligibility to serve on faculty committees, to serve as a student advisor, and to participate in the Program for Enhancing Teaching Effectiveness (PETE); and it acknowledges that those individuals play an active role in the intellectual activities of the University. Faculty status does not carry with it eligibility for tenure or sabbatical, nor does it automatically carry with it faculty rank (Professor, Associate, Assistant Professor, or Instructor), since faculty rank is in a specific academic department, nor does it carry eligibility for other benefits normally assigned to full-time teaching faculty.
