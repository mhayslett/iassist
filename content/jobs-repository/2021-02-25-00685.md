**Head of Software and Services for Data Science**  
**Stanford University**

The Stanford Libraries invites applications for the position of Head of Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) supporting training and guidance for data science applications in the social sciences and digital humanities. SSDS is a part of the Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR), the Stanford Libraries center of excellence for data and software support serving the needs of social science and humanities researchers across the University. The Head of SSDS will continue the long-running success of SSDS as a university-wide service for data-driven research scholarship while growing CIDRâ€™s capacity as a hub for digital and computational research support.  The successful candidate will be responsible for providing broad support for traditional and computational analysis of these materials, including data management, data analysis and workflows, ethical considerations, and by organizing workshops, tutorials, and consulting. The candidate will play a key role within the Libraries to coordinate text and data mining services and the management of data assets and act as local resource for questions coming in from other public facing Library services.
