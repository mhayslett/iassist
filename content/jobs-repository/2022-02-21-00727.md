The Health Foundation (London) is looking for a Senior Data Manager to join the NDL team.

The Networked Data Lab (NDL) is a pioneering collaborative network of analysts who use linked data, open analytics, and public and patient involvement to tackle the most pressing challenges in health and social care. The team is looking an enthusiastic Senior Data Manager to work on the NDLs data stewardship programme, which is a major priority for the team.  The role includes responsibility for the day-to-day IG and data access arrangements with the local NDL’s partners. There is scope to work on some quite exciting dataset development projects, and to coordinate data harmonisation efforts across local linked datasets.

Information about the NDL can be found at https://www.health.org.uk/funding-and-partnerships/our-partnerships/the-networked-data-lab

The role would be well suited to someone with an interest in influencing progress against FAIR data principles in local health systems and there’s obviously a strong collaborative component to the work. We are also looking for someone who would be able to promote NDL’s data stewardship work externally, so an interest in public speaking or writing would be a plus.

The closing date is the 6th  March 2022.
