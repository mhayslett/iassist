Head, Metadata Services
University of California, Berkeley Library

Hiring range: Librarian  
Salary Range: $86, 534 to $104,276 annually (salary based on qualifications)  
This is a full time appointment

The University of California, Berkeley Library seeks an innovative and engaged information professional to lead the Metadata Services unit and to help provide guidance and strategic direction for the future of resource description for the Library, colleagues in the UC consortium, and beyond.

**THE ENVIRONMENT**  
The University of California, Berkeley, is one of the world's most iconic teaching and research institutions. Since 1868 Berkeley has fueled a perpetual renaissance, generating unparalleled intellectual, economic, and social value in California, the United States, and the world. Berkeley's culture of openness, freedom, and acceptance — academic and artistic, political and cultural — make it a very special place for students, faculty, and staff. Berkeley is committed to hiring and developing staff who want to work in a high-performing culture that supports the outstanding work of our faculty and students. Candidates are encouraged to read more about the UC Berkeley culture at http://jobs.berkeley.edu/why-berkeley.html.
In a highly-diverse and intellectually-rich environment, Berkeley serves a campus community of over 30,000 undergraduate students, 11,000 graduate students, and 1,500 faculties. The Library also serves the people of California, and the world, through lending to over 35 countries a year, and making available a rapidly-growing archive of digitized special collections materials (over 4 million items so far). The UC Berkeley Library has contributed over 3 million digitized books to HathiTrust.
The Library comprises 25 campus libraries, with a collection of nearly 13 million circulating volumes, almost 1.5 million e-books, subscriptions to over 130,000 journals and periodicals, and about 200 million items in its special collections, including rare materials held by The Bancroft Library, the C. V. Starr East Asian Library, the Bioscience, Natural Resources & Public Health Library, the Music Library, and the Anthropology Library. The UC Berkeley Library actively partners with the other nine UC campuses and the systemwide California Digital Library. The Library manages the systemwide off-site Northern Regional Library Facility. The Library has an operating budget of about $62 million with approximately 325 full-time employees and 600 student employees.

**RESPONSIBILITIES**  
Reporting to the Head of the Collections Services Division and working closely with unit heads for Acquisitions and Preservation, and other collaborating units in the Library, the Head of Metadata Services will oversee the creation of metadata for materials acquired and created by the University and provide vision for the delivery of new services within the area of resource description and discovery.
The Head of Metadata Services will build the metadata capabilities in the unit by fostering an environment of collaboration, innovation, accountability, and ongoing learning. This may be accomplished by assessing staff training and development, promoting library-wide collaboration, and keeping abreast of current and new practices within the rapidly evolving realm of information management and discovery. The Head will also serve as an authoritative resource person for metadata related questions, supervise and contribute to the creation of original and complex adaptive catalog records using MARC 21, RDA, LCSH and LCC, and support the UC Berkeley Library's participation in the Program for Cooperative Cataloging. The Head of Metadata Services will help lead the implementation of Linked Data at Berkeley.
The Head of Metadata Services is responsible for supervising staff and librarians in the unit.
The Head of Metadata Services is expected to be a key player in building effective relationships with colleagues both nationally and internationally as new metadata standards emerge.
