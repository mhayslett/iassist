The Research Data and Digital Scholarship (RDDS) team at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries is looking for a digital scholarship programmer to be the server-side programmer and technical lead on data-intensive digital humanities and digital scholarship projects. The incumbent will work alongside RDDS team members with skills in data science, text mining, design, digital cultural heritage, scholarly communication, data visualization, and mapping to create lightweight web applications, digital humanities tools, and digital projects in collaboration with Penn faculty and students. As a project technical lead, they will have excellent knowledge of scripting languages such as Python; web-development technologies and frameworks (Javascript, CSS, HTML5); and relational and NoSQL databases. As a faculty-and-student facing member of the RDDS team, they will also have sound project management chops and a knack for explaining complex ideas to a broad variety of stakeholders.

- Serve as technical lead on digital scholarship projects involving server-side coding of web-based applications, training students where applicable
- In collaboration with Libraries colleagues, contribute technical expertise to budding efforts to promote library collections as data
- In collaboration with the RDDS team and others, develop and maintain open-source tools, platforms, or projects for digital scholarly use
- Provide guidance and recommendations for technical infrastructure for digital scholarship projects
- As a member of the RDDS team, provide instruction and consultation on digital scholarship methods in the humanities and social sciences, with a particular focus on text and data mining

All Research Data and Digital Scholarship team members are expected and encouraged to dedicate one half-day a week to collaborative, creative, research, or professional development activities.

The RDDS team values collaboration, transparency, equity, openness, and accessibility in their work and is looking for colleagues who share their commitment to an inclusive, ethical, anti-racist praxis.
