UCL is a world-leading teaching and research university, often ranked in the top ten in the world with an annual turnover of well over £1 billion. Part of UCL’s vision is to take on the hardest global challenges.

The UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing (ARC) is UCL’s new institute for infrastructure and innovation in digital research - the supercomputers, datasets, software, and people that make computational science and digital scholarship possible.

We are an innovative hybrid: a professional services department that delivers reliable and secure infrastructure and services to UCL research groups, and a laboratory for research and innovation in the application of advanced computational and dataintensive research methods, working in partnership with academics from all fields.

We are a home for the research technology professionals - research software engineers, HPC systems engineers, dev-ops specialists, data engineers, data scientists and data stewards - who support and collaborate in the delivery of UCL research, providing outstanding career development opportunities for these new kinds of research professionals.

This post will be based in the Research Data Group within ARC. The Research Data Group provides data management and stewardship services across UCL’s research community. Services include managed data storage, data publication, electronic research notebooks, and research information management. The group supports research reproducibility and open science, facilitating the confident re-use of research outputs in innovative ways. This is a rapidly developing field, and the group is expanding to reflect that.
