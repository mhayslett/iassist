## Marketing

IASSIST does not send you marketing emails nor share your data for marketing purposes. Our members may share on the discussion lists information on events that they believe to be relevant to IASSIST members. Marketing is not allowed on discussion lists either. You can always opt out and unsubscribe from the list. 

## How do we share data we collect?

We don't share your data with vendors or any third parties not directly governed by IASSIST to run a service for IASSIST. We do not allow any commercial use of your data. We may share data with an outside party as required for regulatory, legal, or compliance reasons. 

The following companies get your personal information for the purposes defined below:

- SimplyVoting for running biennial elections (name, email)
- Electric Embers to maintain listservs and organizational email addresses (name, email)
- Open Journal Systems when you publish a paper in the IASSIST Quarterly (name, email)
- In addition, we use a variety of cloud services such as Google Drive and Zoom to transact association business. Interacting with such services may result in personal data collected by them.  

In addition, members in good standing have access to information that individuals choose to make public through the membership database.  Members can change what information is available to others at any time. Members with access to personal information are expected to abide by the intent of this policy.  Information made available through the membership directory or other organizational activities is not to be redistributed without permission or used for commercial purposes.

## How do we store and process your data? 

IASSIST will keep your membership data for as long as your membership is active, or as needed to provide you services, including reactivation. Information on lapsed memberships will be kept for  5 years. Once this time period has expired, we will delete your data by removing it from the active database. Your membership data will be archived for research and statistical purposes but not used for any marketing or emailing. If you have a concern about the accuracy of data, you may correct, amend, update, or partly delete it by signing into the membership site.

IASSIST stores membership data on its membership database which is run by Wild Apricot Inc, a site dedicated to manage membership data for small associations and nonprofits. Wild Apricot is a Canadian based service provider, headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. Its services are run on Amazon Web Services infrastructure and advertise the following security information:

Access to your complete data has been granted only to those IASSIST officials who need to manage it. All members can see your public details in the membership directory. Individuals who are not members have no access to the membership directory. 

But regardless of where we store and process data, we protect our members' information as is described in this privacy policy. We have reviewed our privacy practices and believe them to be in line with known existing data protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  Should this policy deviate from legal requirements covering any IASSIST members, we will update the policy within 30 days of being notified of the disparity.
