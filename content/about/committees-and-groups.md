Action Groups undertake specific tasks, find solutions to specific
problems, or develop and compile relevant materials for specific
projects.

None at the moment.

Interest Groups {#interest}
---------------

Interest Groups share information on specific subjects with the larger
IASSIST membership and serve as a forum of discussion between as well as
during annual meetings. Read more about IASSIST Interest Groups and see
the **[Interest Group
Checklist](https://iassistdata.org/about/all-about-interest-groups).**

**[Geospatial Interest Group](https://iassistdata.org/community/geoig) (GEOIG)**
:   The central purpose of the IASSIST-Geo interest group is to create a
    network for members focused on issues of geospatial data as related
    to the social sciences. Expected outcomes include developing a
    connected and informed group, opportunities for professional
    development through training, shared professional tools, resources
    for all IASSIST members to make use of, both members and non-members
    of the IG, and an elevated awareness of social sciences and place.\
    **2019-2020 Co-Chairs:** *Jennie Murack, murack\@mit.edu and Amanda
    Tickner, atickner\@msu.edu*

**[Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group](https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/iassistqsshdig/home "OSSHDIG webiste") (QSSHDIG)**
:   The central purpose of the IASSIST Qualitative Social Science and
    Humanities Data Interest Group is to foster conversations regarding
    the needs of researchers who generate qualitative data, and what
    types of services librarians and other information professionals can
    develop to support these researchers in managing their data/source
    materials throughout the research lifecycle.\
    Expected outcomes include\
    1) developing a connected and informed group,\
    2) providing opportunities for professional development through
    training, and\
    3) collecting and creating tools and resources for all IASSIST
    members to make use of (both IG members and non-members).\
    **2019-2020 Co-Chairs:** *Sebastian

**[Health Data Interest Group](https://iassistdata.org/hdig "Health Data Interest Group") (HDIG)**
:   The availability of health data about individuals, gathered from
    surveys or health care systems, are an invaluable resource for
    researchers who wish to examine interactions between individuals and
    the healthcare they receive. In addition, there is now much more
    demand for research and analysis of linked health and social data
    (for example, health records linked with education or social
    security records). Particular challenges face data professionals who
    seek to acquire health, and linked health data. The IASSIST Health
    Data Interest Group has been established to bring together data
    practitioners and technicians who manage access to health, and
    health-linked data for research purposes, in order to share
    expertise and enable members to overcome challenges in their
    day-to-day roles.\
    **2019-2020 Chair:** *Richard Welpton,

**[Data Visualization Interest Group](https://iassistdata.org/community/dvig) (DVIG)**
:   This group focused on promoting a greater understanding of data
    visualization -- its creation, uses, and importance in research,
    across disciplines. Data Visualization supports a means to make
    sense of data, through visual representation, and to communicate
    ideas and information effectively.\
    \
    Particular areas of focus and discussions included, but were not
    limited to the following:
:   **·** Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance
    their skills in this growing field\
    **·** Support a culture of best practice for data visualization
    techniques; creation, use, and curation\
    **·** Discussion of the relevant tools for all kinds of data
    visualizations\
    **·** Provide input and feedback on data visualization tools\
    **·** Capture examples of data visualization to emulate and avoid\
    **·** Explore opportunities for service development in libraries\
    **·** Use of data visualization for allowing pre-analysis browsing
    of data content in repositories\
    **·** Be aware of and communicate to others the needs of researchers
    in this field\
    **·** Connect with communities of metadata developers and users to
    gain better understanding of how metadata can enable better
    visualization, and how in turn visualization need might drive
    development of metadata standards\

<!-- -->

**Open Source Interest Group (OSIG)**
:   Open source programming languages like R and Python are rapidly
    transforming the landscape of data management and analysis. These
    free tools offer similar and in some cases better functionality than
    their commercial equivalents and simultaneously benefit from free
    community support from a vast network of developers and users. This
    interest group will provide a forum for IASSIST members to share
    information on how to promote the use of open source languages by
    those whose work we support as well as ways in which we might
    contribute back to the open source community.\

**Data Management & Curation Interest Group (SIGDMC)**

This interest group focused on issues related to research data
management and curation, in order to support members' work in this
field. Sound data management and curation strategies ensure that
research data will be available for sharing, dissemination and reuse
over time. These strategies are not only important for data
preservation, but, in a growing number of countries, a necessity for
research groups in order to receive funding.\
\
The role and function of the data management and curation interest group
included but was not limited to the following:

**·** Maintain an [inventory of materials, resources, and
policies](/resources/category/data-management-and-curation) related to
sound data management and curation internationally\
**·** Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance
their skills in this field\
**·** Foster information-sharing among IASSIST members of their work in
this area at their institutions\
**·** Maintain awareness of data management and curation issues
internationally across\
  disciplines, including beyond the social sciences\
**·** Seek opportunities for outreach and advocacy on issues related to
data management,\
  including to organizations with similar missions\
**·** Examine issues related to collaborative ventures with research
groups\
**·** Provide input and feedback on data curation tools

**[Data Citation Interest Group](https://iassistdata.org/community/sigdc) (SIGDC)**
:   This interest group seeked to promote awareness of data-related
    research and scholarship through data citation. Citing data supports
    the discovery and reuse of data, leading to better science through
    the validation of results. It also recognizes data as an essential
    part of the scientific record.
