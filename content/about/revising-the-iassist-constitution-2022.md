On March 2, 2022, IASSIST President San Cannon announced that the Administrative Committee has endorsed a revision of the IASSIST constitution and has recommended that it be ratified by the general membership after a constitutionally required two-month notice period.  To that end, a vote of ratification will be open to the IASSIST membership in early May 2022.  Once ratified, the constitution will go into effect after the June Business Meeting. 

The path leading up to the final proposed language was a long one and involved substantial review and input from various members of the Administrative Committee, IASSIST officers, committee chairs, and other interested IASSIST members.  The IASSIST Constitutional Review Committee worked for months on proposed revisions; the final product reflects a wide and inclusive range of modifications—some provided operational clarity while others acknowledged the changing nature of communication in today’s world and the need for regional flexibility in some areas of our membership.

## Why did the administrative committee decide to amend the IASSIST constitution?

The last revisions to the Constitution were made over 10 years ago, and it was time to refresh and revise this essential governing document.  Among the goals were:  To update the description of the objectives of the organization, to incorporate electronic voting and remote meeting participation, to update the duties of the officers, to clarify and make consistent the quorum and voting rules for business operations and elections, to add a new section in the by-laws about IASSIST Regional Chapters, and to make an overall cleanup of language and consistency.

**The following is a summary of the substantive amendments, article by article, to have on hand as you read through the proposed revision of the constitution.  As stated above, this review period is from March 2 until early May 2022.**
