### European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI)

The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures ([ESFRI](http://cordis.europa.eu/esfri/)) published its roadmap in 
October 2006. The roadmap presents new, large-scale Research Infrastructures, 
based on an international peer review, and identifies 35 important 
infrastructure projects from seven key research areas. One of the key research 
ares is Social Sciences and Humanities, where the following six projects were 
considered considered as crucial pillars to strengthen the European Research 
Area, in particular for capacity building:

- CESSDA (see below) 
- CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) is a 
  large scale pan-European coordinated infrastructure effort to make language 
  resources and technology available and useful to scholars of all disciplines, 
  in particular the humanities and social sciences. 
- DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) will 
  be based upon an existing network of Data Centres and Services based in 
  Germany (Max Planck Society), France (CNRS), the Netherlands (DANS) and the 
  United Kingdom (AHDS). 
- EROHS (European Resource Observatory for the Humanities and the Social 
  Sciences) will operate both as a central and distributed facility with a 
  strong physical hub working in close conjunction with a number of spokes 
  across Europe, harnessing European expertise through a coordinated yet 
  decentralised network. It will be organised to promote and ensure cooperation 
  and integration of data, technologies and policies. 
- ESS (see below) 
- SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) provides data 
  infrastructure for fact-based economic and social science analyses of the 
  on-going changes in Europe due to population ageing.

### Council of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA)

The Council of European Social Science Data Archives ([CESSDA](http://www.cessda.org/)) is included as a social sciences 
infrastructure in the ESFRI Roadmap. This increases the possibility that CESSDA 
will received funding from the EU's Research Framework Programme FP7 during the 
years 2007-2013. CESSDA has submitted a bid for a major upgrade of the existing 
CESSDA Research Infrastructure, in order to ensure that European researchers 
have access to and gain support for the data resources they require to conduct 
research of the highest quality.

European data archivists travelled to Athens in October 2006 to attend the 
annual CESSDA Expert Seminar. The seminar, titled Open Access to Data, focused 
on data protection and anonymisation. Presentations and discussions brought into 
highlight a well-known fact: EU countries have applied the Data Protection 
Directive differently, each in their own way. For example, national statistics 
agencies disseminate micro data for research purposes on different grounds. 

Activities include also renewing the [CESSDA website](http://www.cessda.org/) and creating a new common data catalogue, the CESSDA Data Portal, that allows easy access to the catalogues of member organisations. The Data Portal builds on the work of the EU funded project MADIERA, which in turn was based on DDI, ELSST thesaurus and Nesstar technology.

### European Social Survey (ESS)

The European Social Survey ([ESS](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/)) is an academically-driven 
social survey designed to chart and explain the interaction between Europe's 
changing institutions and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of its 
diverse populations. The survey covers over 25 European nations and employs 
rigorous methodology. The first round was fielded in 2002/2003, the second in 
2004/2005. The cumulative data and documentation from Rounds 1 and 2 were 
published in the beginning of 2007. Round 3 fieldwork (themes: Personal and 
Social Well-being and Timing of Life) began in September 2006, and data and 
documentation from round 3 will be available to users in the autumn of 2007.

The ESS was nominated in the The European Strategy Forum on Research 
Infrastructures ([ESFRI](http://cordis.europa.eu/esfri/)) Roadmap as 
one of the next generation of large-scale Research Infrastructures.

### East European Data Archive Network ([EDAN](http://www.gesis.org/en/cooperation/data_service/eastern_europe/index.htm))

*Brigitte Hausstein ([GESIS Service Agency Eastern Europe](http://www.gesis.org/en/gesis_branch_office/index.htm)) writes:*

1. EDAN continued its cooperation project on data documentation with Latvia 
and Serbia: The Latvian Social Science Data Archive, LSZDA (Riga) and the Center 
of Political Studies and Public Opinion Research of the Institute of Social 
Sciences Belgrade (Serbia) documented (according to DDI several election studies 
conducted in their countries and made them publicly available. 
2. The 
"Initiative for Social Science Data Archive" in Croatia joined EDAN. Researchers 
from a number of academic institutions as well as from public research 
institutes started to set up a national data archive. 
3. EDAN is involved in 
the widening and strengthening activities of CESSDA. It contributed to the EU 
FP7 application for a Preparatory Phase bid planning for a 'major upgrade' of 
the CESSDA Research Infrastructure.

### Denmark

During 2006 the Dansk Data Arkiv ([DDA](http://www.dda.dk/)) 
documented fully 58 data materials. A major project on systematising the Danish 
keywords found in the study information database and making them more compatible 
with international standards was set in motion. This would also facilitate a 
future expansion of the Danish search catalogue.

Two new persons were added to the staff. One is hired for one year to work 
with the acquisition of social science surveys and the other is hired for two 
years to do software development. Furthermore, DDA Health established a network 
for specially selected users. The purposes of the network is e.g. to help in 
identifying new surveys and in promoting the knowledge of DDA.

DDA participated in the DDI Alliance with a chair of the Expert Committee and 
contributed to the Cessda activities with running the secretariat. DDA is also 
representend in the Danish Research Council's working group on research 
infrastructure for the humanities. 

### Finland

In February 2007, the Ministry of Education set up a project group to provide 
recommendations for organising the collection, preservation and use of 
electronic data in Finland. FSD's director is a member of the group. The project 
aims to produce national guidelines, focusing primarily on the electronic 
material published by institutions governed by the Ministry of Education. 

For the [Finnish Social Science Data Archive](http://www.fsd.uta.fi/english/) (FSD), the year 2006 was succesful. Several projects were finished: the popular Research Methods Web Resource (MOTV in Finnish) was expanded to include qualitative methods, FSD Handbook on Secondary Use of Data was 
published, as well as the database POHTIVA which offers political manifestoes 
and other political texts produced by Finnish political parties over the years. 
FSD also had a role in the Finnish ISSP2006, WVS fifth wave, ESS and CSES data 
projects and continued to fund the Finnish membership in the Luxembourg Income 
Study (LIS). 

The findings from the Open Access survey, carried out by the FSD and funded 
by the Ministry of Education, showed that only ten per cent of university 
departments have any stated guidelines or rules as regards the preservation of 
research data. National data archives for different disciplines were regarded to 
be a good way to organise the archiving of data.

### Hungary

*Zolt√°n Lux ([1956 Institute Public Foundation](http://www.rev.hu/index_en.html)) writes:*

The Institute's website ([http://www.rev.hu/](http://www.rev.hu/)) underwent renewal in 2006. This included preparation of a new design and development into a real portal service based on the Oracle Internet Application Server.. 

Complex multimedia content entitled *[Jubilee web pages](http://server2001.rev.hu/msite/)* was added for the 50th anniversary of the '56 Hungarian Revolution. Its four themes (Budapest Insurgent Groups, Literature in the Revolution, Hungarian Students in Austria in 1956-7, and The 1956 Revolution in the World Press) were integrated into the earlier [Private History project](http://server2001.rev.hu/oha/index.html).

Further development was made of the photo documentary database. Digitalization, content description and downloading of about 4000 new photo documents were begun.Work continued, with support from the Photographic Professional Board of the National Cultural Foundation, on researching the biographies of still living photographers, and archiving photo documents and life-interviews in the 1956 Institute Contemporary History Database. The public records in the Photo Documentary Database have been connected to the National Digital Database (NDA), so that they are now also accessible on the NDA portal ([http://search.nda.hu/](http://search.nda.hu/)) 

The earlier multimedia project entitled [Private History. 1956 and the K√°d√°r Period](http://server2001.rev.hu/oha/index_eng.html), developed in 2006, was awarded the Erasmus Euromedia Prize. 

### Ireland

In early summer 2006, the (http://www.hea.ie/)[Higher Education Authority] (HEA) and Forf's agreed to conduct a review of the research infrastructure in Ireland. The purpose of the review was to internationally benchmark the research infrastructure in the higher-education sector in particular and to identify gaps in the national platform of research infrastructure, which could be addressed in the short to medium term. The key finding is that notwithstanding the significant investment of funds in research infrastructure since 1998, and the remarkable transformation of the Irish research landscape since that time, weaknesses exist and gaps remain in the higher-education and national research infrastructure. The [review report](http://www.hea.ie/uploads/pdf/Research%20Infrastructure%20in%20Ireland%20-%20Building%20for%20Tomorrow%202007.pdf) states, for example, that the absence of an adequate national data archive is a serious impediment to social science research in Ireland, as well as to research undertaken in other countries that is inclusive of data pertaining to Ireland.

The report identified the [Irish Social Science Data Archive](http://www.ucd.ie/issda/) (ISSDA) as a service with "the potential to be a key infrastructural resource, despite being under-resourced". Subsequent to this, proposals for a greatly expanded ISSDA were submitted to the Higher Education Authority as part of the UCD application for funding in Cycle 4 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI). This process is still ongoing.

### The Netherlands

*Marion Wittenberg ([DANS](http://www.dans.knaw.nl/en/)) writes:*

DANS is buzzing with activities. Now operational is the DANS EASY system 
which is a do-it-yourself web application for depositing data and the 
accompanying documentation: [http://easy.dans.knaw.nl/dms](http://easy.dans.knaw.nl/dms). This is a 
quite complicated system which can be used both by the data users, the data 
depositors and the archivists.

One of the large scale projects which has started up early in 2007 is MIXED. 
This is basically a research and development program in the field of long term 
digital preservation defining an archival format in XML for databases and 
spreadsheets. 

DANS will, furthermore, participate in four European projects (7th Research 
Framework Program), if all applications are granted: Preparing DARIAH (European 
data infrastructure for the humanities), CESSDA RI (European data infrastructure 
for the social sciences), CLIO-INFRA (on social-economic historical data) and 
IPYDLE (on research data created in the International Polar Year 
2007/2008).

### Norway

[Norwegian Social Science Data Services](http://www.nsd.uib.no/english/) (NSD) is actively involved in several national and international projects, for example European Social Survey (ESS), Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC), Ecclesiastical Database (the basis for the Church of Norway's official statistics) and Elite data (data about political elites and the political and administrative system in Norway).

New projects include for example the new Regional Database, based on the 
Commune Database. The new database will offer a far better and up-to-data 
functionality including a more comprehensive usability and a more advanced 
metadata functions. The system will be implemented during 2007. NSD is also 
included in the Eurosphere project, which started in mid-February. The project 
is funded via FP6 and has partners from 17 universities and research 
institutions. The objective is to develop innovative perspectives on the 
European public area, and to identify factors that have influences on this. The 
project use data from Eurobarometer, ESS, CivicActive and data collected 
especially for this purpose. NSD has conducted school elections for ten rounds. 
The last round was held in 2005 in connection with the election for the 
Norwegian Parliament.This years the Norwegian Directorate for Education and 
Training decided that the project shall go on for five years and cover three 
elections; 2007, 2009 and 2011. After a competitive tendering NSD was given the 
contract. 

More than 140 institutions, including the universities and university 
colleges, public and private colleges, the major national research institutes, 
the major university hospitals as well as several other hospitals have appointed 
NSD as their ombudsman for privacy in research. These agreements make NSD the 
mandatory data protection official for all research projects within these 
institutions. This means that a majority of research projects that involve the 
processing of personal information regulated by the Personal Data Act or the 
Personal Health Data Filing System Act should submit their research for review 
by the Data Protection Official for Research. 

### Slovenia

Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) shows a long-term determination to support 
the activities of Arhiv Druzboslovnih Podatkov, Univerza v Ljubljani ([ADP](http://www.adp.fdv.uni-lj.si/index_an.html) by acknowledgment of 
data delivery to ADP as explicit criteria of successful evaluation of research 
projects. Following this a transfer of metadata study descriptions from ADP 
catalogue to a Common Slovene libraries catalogue is underway. 

In ADP, further acquisition of data form broad social science and 
interdisciplinary is underway, with the special emphasis on the data from public 
and governmental sector, especially Statistical Office's. As a result in 2006 a 
Microdata of 2002 Slovenian Census is available. Also full Slovene language and 
ADP "look and feel" customisation of a NESSTAR server was finished.<A

### Spain

[Archivo de Estudios Sociales, Centro de Investigaciones Sociol√≥gicas](http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/EN/index.html) (ARCES/CIS) has continued with the ordinary activities of servicing users, disseminating files and related materials and cataloguing datasets. The information in the web page with free access has increased substantially, with the corresponding decreasing in the demanded information by other means. The results of the published studies with the cross tabulation by the typical socioeconomic variables has started to be presented at the web page from this year. Other changes have also been made with the administration of the web page to improve the access conditions. The CIS has worked this year in new survey methods and has made significant changes in the 300 hours post-graduated course in applied social research and data analysis training.

### Sweden

[Svensk Samh√§llsvetenskaplig Datatj√§nst](http://www.ssd.gu.se/) 
(Swedish Social Science Data Service, SSD) is now under the governance of the 
The Database InfraStructure Committee (DISC) within the Research Council.

The Swedish Research Council has decided to make a major effort on research 
data bases, and for this purpose the Data Infrastructure Committee (DISC) was 
established in the beginning of 2006. The assignment of DISC is to coordinate 
and conduct efforts to make research data bases accessible within social 
sciences, epidemiology/population health and the humanities. Part of this work 
is to establish the Swedish National Data Service (SND). SND will replace the 
Swedish Social Science Data Service (SSD). In November 2006 all Swedish 
universities were invited to apply for hosting SND. Five universities - 
G√∂teborg, Lund, Uppsala, Stockholm and √ñrebro - applied. The research council is 
expected to make the decision of host university at the end of May 2007.

In April 2007, SSD launched its new website that offers a new design, better 
opportunities to search SSD's data catalogue, and much more.


### Switzerland

*Reto Hadorn (SIDOS) writes:*

[Swiss information and data archive service for the social sciences](http://www.sidos.ch/index-e.html) (SIDOS) was funded by the federal goverment from the start in 1992, as a Foundation of the Swiss Academy for Human and Social Sciences. For several years now, discussions have taken place about ways to further the interest of researchers for available data and the and ways to set up a steady collaboration with the official statistics. These discussions result now in a new setting:

- A new entity is created, which covers service activities (information 
  about ongoing research and data publishing), data collection activities (ESS, 
  ISSP, MOSAiCH, electoral studies (SELECTS) and the Swiss Household Panel) and 
  research activities. The Services get additional resources as well as an 
  extension to publish data from the Swiss Statistical Office. 
- This new entity will be installed at the University of Lausanne, which 
  contributes both with infrastructures and a research program focused on using 
  available data 
- Funding comes from multiple agencies: the State Secretariat for Education 
  and Research for the services, the Swiss National Science Foundation for the 
  data collection activities and the University of Lausanne for the research 
  activities. 
- The new organisation will be enforced in January 2008. 

The decision to go that way has been formally taken April 2007 and work is 
presently done to define the implementation procedures. A lot of questions still 
open: 

- the name of the new agency 
- the legal form, either a foundation as SIDOS was or an academic institute 
  of the University of Lausanne 
- the governance of the whole - which will be the autonomy of the Services? 
- the type of research: thematic, focused on inequality and poverty, or 
  exclusively methodologic 
- managers think of pooling the IT resources; a lot depends on the quality 
  of the audit. 

The Services (presently SIDOS) will greatly benefit from the increase of 
resources (+ 100% according to the plans). But change fosters insecurity, the 
staff rotation accelerates. Dominique Joye, director since 1999, has left SIDOS 
for the University of Lausanne, where he was deeply involved with the 
elaboration of the project the University drafted to compete for hosting the new 
agency. Reto Hadorn was appointed as an ad interim director to bridge the gap 
until the director of the new agency takes his office.

SIDOS is working on an on line translation tool for study description level 
metadata (DDI 2). It is tailored to the relational database used at SIDOS for 
metadata management but will actually be used to make the translations necessary 
for (a) multilingual data publication on the SIDOS NESSTAR server (German and 
French) and (b) metadata publication on the CESSDA server (English). It will be 
able to handle any number of languages. Translation profiles make it possible to 
translate distinct sets of elements for the publication on the SIDOS server and 
the CESSDA server. The current name name of the application is DDILINGUO. The 
project is self funded. 

### United Kingdom

***UK Data Archive***

*Louise Corti (UKDA) writes:*

The UK Economic and Research Council (ESRC) decided at its February 2007 
meeting to extend support for [ESDS](http://www.esds.ac.uk/) of which 
a major partner for a further five years to October 2012. This is excellent news 
for a longer term future. Additional funding has been secured from ESRC to 
obtain licences to distribute both the important Latinobarometro and Datastream 
collections. It is hoped to have these available for users by August 2007. A 
sixth major study has been added to the Longitudinal portfolio - the 
Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), also known as Next Steps. 
This is a major innovative panel study of young people which brings together 
data from a number of different sources, including both annual interviews with 
young people, their parents and administrative sources. Other important new 
acquisitions in this period have included the European Working Conditions Survey 
series, a major EU survey series deposited for the first time, the British 
Election Study, 2005 and the Electoral Reform and the British MEP: Qualitative 
Interviews with 61 British Members of the European Parliament. Two major surveys 
have also been enhanced and released via Nesstar for the first time as a result 
of liaison work with the depositor (the NI Continuous Household Survey, 2005 and 
WERS 2004). 

In addition to these new acquisitions and data enhancement work, it is 
important to note work that is conducted with data producers. UKDA continue to 
hold regular meetings with a number of different data producers. Of particular 
note in this regard have been the on-going discussions with The National 
Archives (TNA) to produce and implement a common shared data preservation policy 
relating government departments. 

In February, a special issue of the journal Methodological Innovations Online 
was edited by Louise Corti (ESDS Qualidata). This collection of papers entitled 
'Making qualitative data more re-usable: issues of context and representation' 
focuses on defining and capturing context of raw qualitative data in relation to 
sharing and re-use rather than original interpretation. The papers arise out of 
workshop previously organised by ESDS Qualidata as part of the Qualitative 
Archiving and Data Sharing Scheme (QUADS). Also in this period two issues UK 
Databytes have been published, together with an issue of the ESDS Government 
newsletter. 

UKDA has also continued to received a number of visitors from overseas, 
usually wanting to learn more about how ESDS works. Visitors in this period have 
included Professor Oleg Karasev, Director of Statistics at Moscow University; a 
delegation from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a team from the South 
African Human Sciences Research Council. 

UKDA has been testing and evaluating the Lucene search engine software. It is 
planned to move over to this for the central ESDS catalogue, resulting in 
improved functionality. A new version (3.5) of the Nesstar on-line data browsing 
software was implemented in March. This has includes new and improved 
functionality including: the ability to compute/recode variables; calculations 
can now be performed on categories within tables; the ability to perform 
correlation analyses; bookmarks can now contain descriptive information. 

The UKDA has recently been successful in winning funding from JISC under the 
Repositories and Preservation Programme for the Data Exchange Tools and 
Conversion Utilities (DExT) project. This will build on ESDS Qualidata's 
previous work of systematic preservation and sharing of qualitative data, aiming 
to develop data exchange models and data conversion tools for empirical research 
data. The project will have significant impact on ESDS in relation to the 
preservation back-end and how this interacts with the dissemination download 
tools. 

The UKDA (and the UK representative for the Council of European Social 
Science Data Archives - CESSDA) have prepared an EU FP7 application for a 
Preparatory Phase bid planning for a 'major upgrade' of the CESSDA Research 
Infrastructure. 


***EDINA &amp; Edinburgh University Data Library in Scotland***

*Robin Rice ([EDINA and University Data Library](http://datalib.ed.ac.uk/about/)) writes:*

EDINA, based at the University of Edinburgh, has been funded by JISC (Joint 
Information Systems Committee) to undertake a variety of repository-related 
development activities to enhance access to academic research outputs in the UK. 
The GRADE project has been investigating and reporting on the technical, legal 
and cultural issues around the reuse of geospatial data and has built a 
demonstrator repository for sharing derived geospatial data with other licensed 
users. With the DataShare project, by supporting academics within four UK 
universities who wish to share datasets on which written research outputs are 
based, a network of institution-based data repositories will develop a niche 
model for deposit of 'orphaned datasets' currently filled neither by centralised 
subject-domain data archives/centres/grids nor by eprint-based institutional 
repositories. The purpose of the Depot is to ensure that all UK academics can 
enjoy the benefits of Open Access by providing a repository for the interim 
period before every university has such repository provision: it is geared to 
peer-reviewed postprints but has implications for data deposit - *'Put it in 
the Depot'* - with functionality that would re-direct those wanting to 
deposit datasets and other research outputs to suitable repositories, such as 
institutional repositories and data archives. 

Member's highlights:

- Alison Bayley enjoyed her first year of retirement from EDINA/Data Library 
  whilst remaining busy chairing the Scottish Women's Rural Institute. 
- Peter Burnhill gave a keynote speech to ASEAN/AUNILO in Brunei on sharing 
  scholarly resources; and is on the Board for CLOCKSS (Controlled LOCKSS: a 
  community-governed partnership of publishers and libraries working to achieve 
  a sustainable and globally distributed archive of published scholarly 
  literature. 
- Stuart Macdonald worked with Bristol University as Editor for the Social 
  Statistics section of Intute - the UK's resource discovery service. 
- Robin Rice collaborated on a funding council scoping study to identify 
  quantitative methods capacity building needs in Scotland.
