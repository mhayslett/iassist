The mission of the **IASSIST Fellows Program** is to provide support for data professionals from countries with emerging economies and underrepresented regions who are developing information infrastructures regarding the use and preservation of public and private data and implementing information policy decisions at their home institutions. IASSIST Fellows has provided financial assistance to over 70 conference participants from around the world since 1997.

The mission of the **IASSIST Early Professional Fellows Program** is  to provide support for early career data professionals from under-resourced institutions and recognize the value of new and innovative ideas from graduates and professionals new to data in the social sciences, who may not otherwise have the funding to travel.

Please be aware that **funding is not intended to cover the entire cost of attending the conference. The applicant's home institution must provide some level of financial support to supplement an IASSIST Fellow award**.  Strong preference will be given to first time participants and applicants from those countries currently with insufficient representation at IASSIST. Only fully completed applications will be considered. Applicants submitting a paper for the conference will be given priority consideration for funding.

- Check the [current year's conference website](/conferences) for information about the conference and applying, including deadlines.

- See [Fellows application form](https://forms.gle/Up684P867QNjH98P7).

For more information, to apply for funding, or nominate a person for a
fellowship, please send an email inquiry to the [Fellows Committee](/about/committees-and-groups/#iassist-fellows)
- Co-Chairs: *Florio Arguillas, foa2 [ at ] cornell.edu* and *Sarah Young, sarahy [ at ] andrew.cmu.edu*
