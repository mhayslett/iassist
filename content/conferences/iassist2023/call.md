## IASSIST 2023 Call for Submissions

We welcome submissions for papers, presentations, panels, posters, and lightning talks. Panel proposals should be made up of speakers from multiple organizations to encourage diversity of debate. Finally, we expect to have many submissions, so we would kindly ask you to restrict submissions to one per person only.

Call for Presentations
While a variety of submission topics are desired, we encourage you to think about if and how your topic may fit into one of the following tracks:

Partnerships and collaborations – What is the data culture like at your organization? What infrastructure – hardware, software, people or policies – are you leveraging, and is it enough? Who do you partner and collaborate with, both within and outside your own organization, and can we learn from these networking environments?

Data management and archiving – How can we build a community of data sharing that is equitable for all? How can we learn from each other’s approaches to demonstrating trust to lay a strong foundation? Have you designed any new and useful approaches and tools that can help in this space?

Data access, governance and ethics – As data practitioners we adhere to key principles of protecting human rights and high ethical standards. What principles, practices and tools have you worked on around data access, especially where there may be added risk in data publishing and use.

Data documentation and reproducibility – For a data community to persist, members need to share a common data language. What new approaches are you using to design documentation to facilitate our shared understanding? What strategies or tools have you designed that will help us respond best to the current reproducibility ‘crisis’?

Data literacy – A robust community includes not only experienced practitioners, but also newcomers. What innovative or successful approaches are you using around the topic of data literacy and how can we, as a community, better equip new practitioners with this important skill?

Data services of the future – What are the needs of researchers and data owners in the future, and how will data services serve them? Ideas about how data services will expand and adapt to increasing and new requirements, and suggestions about entirely new data services will be welcome. How should these data services of the future be designed?

Call for Workshops
Workshops will be held on 6  June  2022. Please use the online submission form to submit your workshop proposal. Choose “Workshop” under Submission Type and make sure to fill out all of the information in the section called Workshops – Additional Information.
