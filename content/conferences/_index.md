## Annual IASSIST Conference

Each spring the annual conference provides data professionals a variety of opportunities to participate in discussions about data sharing and management, data access and repository tools, metadata for research data, best practices for preserving data, global resources for information, new technologies professional development and much more. 

The conference consists of workshops focused on the profession, stimulating plenaries, individual presentations, panels, and posters. Networking opportunities with peers from around the world take place in breakout groups, interest group or birds of a feather sessions, and perhaps most importantly, during the breaks. 

The annual conference is an international event. Conference locations reflect our membership base and typically rotate to a different region each year.

<div style="background-color:#eee;padding:.5em;">Because of the continued health and economic concerns caused by the coronavirus, the Administrative Committee of IASSIST, in conjunction with the Program and Local Arrangements committees, has voted to change the plans for the 2021 conference and hold two events.<br /><br />


The **main conference will be virtual** and will be scheduled for some time in May 2021 with dates to be confirmed shortly.  In addition, we will host a **joint IASSIST/CESSDA meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden from 30 June â€“ 2 July**.


Those who have accepted presentations have been contacted to discuss in which event they would like to participate.  Depending on the distribution of presentations, an additional call for presentations may occur later this year.  


Additional information about programs, registrations, schedules, and information about existing arrangements from the 2020 conference will be made available as soon as possible.  Questions and concerns can be directed to the Executive Committee via IASSIST President Sandra Cannon.
