## Annual IASSIST Conference

Each spring the annual conference provides data professionals a variety of opportunities to participate in discussions about data sharing and management, data access and repository tools, metadata for research data, best practices for preserving data, global resources for information, new technologies professional development and much more. 

The conference consists of workshops focused on the profession, stimulating plenaries, individual presentations, panels, and posters. Networking opportunities with peers from around the world take place in breakout groups, interest group or birds of a feather sessions, and perhaps most importantly, during the breaks. 

The annual conference is an international event. Conference locations reflect our membership base and typically rotate to a different region each year.

<div style="background-color:#eee;padding:.5em;">Because of the continued health and economic concerns caused by the coronavirus, the Administrative Committee of IASSIST, in conjunction with the Program and Local Arrangements committees, has voted to change the plans for the 2021 conference and hold two events.<br /><br />


The **main conference will be virtual and take place in May 17-20, 2021**. 

In addition, we will host a joint **IASSIST/CESSDA meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden**. The in-person meeting is currently scheduled for 14-16 September 2021. 

> Please be aware that IASSIST Leadership and the Local Arrangements Committee in Sweden are monitoring the changing public health and travel issues related to COVID-19. While we fully intend to host the joint meeting in-person, we want to ensure the safety of everyone involved. Therefore, we encourage presenters and attendees to monitor the [conference website](https://www.iassist2021.org/) for the latest information.   

Those who have accepted presentations have been contacted to discuss in which event they would like to participate. 

Questions and concerns can be directed to the Executive Committee via IASSIST President Sandra Cannon.
