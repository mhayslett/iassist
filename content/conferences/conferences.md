## Annual IASSIST Conference

Each spring the annual conference provides data professionals a variety of opportunities to participate in discussions about data sharing and management, data access and repository tools, metadata for research data, best practices for preserving data, global resources for information, new technologies professional development and much more. 

The conference consists of workshops focused on the profession, stimulating plenaries, individual presentations, panels, and posters. Networking opportunities with peers from around the world take place in breakout groups, interest group or birds of a feather sessions, and perhaps most importantly, during the breaks. 

The annual conference is an international event. Conference locations reflect our membership base and typically rotate to a different region each year.

***(March 20, 2020)***

It is with heavy hearts that the IASSIST Executive, Local Arrangements, and Program committees announce that IASSIST 2020 will not happen. Given these unsettled times, the health and safety of our community is paramount.

We are pleased to announce that the conference will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden 7-9 April 2021. We have started to plan how to move the 2020 conference to the new 2021 dates. Stay tuned for more information.

In the meantime, we encourage participants to take whatever steps are available to you to cancel or change your travel plans if you have not already done so. We'll be in touch with those who have already registered about how we will handle the registration fees.
