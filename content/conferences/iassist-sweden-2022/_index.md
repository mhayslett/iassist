### 47th Annual Conference of IASSIST

<!--### Data By Design-->

#### Gothenburg, Sweden, 7-10 June 2022

**Host institution:** Swedish National Data Service (SND)

The conference theme, "Data by Design: Building a Sustainable Data Culture", emphasizes two core values embedded in the culture of Gothenburg and Sweden: design and sustainability. We invite you to explore these topics further and discuss what they could mean to data communities. As a member of IASSIST, you are already part of at least one data community. Your other data communities may be across departments, within organizations, or among groups in different countries. How are these groups helping design a culture of practices around data that will persist across organizations and over time?

Call for Papers and Workshops has been extended and is still open.
: All submissions are due by December 20, 2021. See the conference website for information.
