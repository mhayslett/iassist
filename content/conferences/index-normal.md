## Annual IASSIST Conference

Each spring the annual conference provides data professionals a variety of opportunities to participate in discussions about data sharing and management, data access and repository tools, metadata for research data, best practices for preserving data, global resources for information, new technologies professional development and much more. 

The conference consists of workshops focused on the profession, stimulating plenaries, individual presentations, panels, and posters. Networking opportunities with peers from around the world take place in breakout groups, interest group or birds of a feather sessions, and perhaps most importantly, during the breaks. 

The annual conference is an international event. Conference locations reflect our membership base and typically rotate to a different region each year.

<div style="background-color:#fdebd0;font-weight:bold;padding:.5em;font-size:140%;">Changes to the IASSIST 2021 conference</div>

<div style="background-color:#eee;padding:.5em;">Because of the continued health and economic concerns caused by the coronavirus, the Administrative Committee of IASSIST, in conjunction with the Program and Local Arrangements committees, has voted to change the plans for the 2021 conference and hold two events.<br /><br />


The **main conference will be virtual** and will be scheduled for some time in May 2021 with dates to be confirmed shortly.  In addition, we will host a **joint IASSIST/CESSDA meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden from 30 June – 2 July**.


Those who have accepted presentations will be contacted shortly to discuss in which event they would like to participate.  Depending on the distribution of presentations, an additional call for presentations may occur later this year.  


Additional information about programs, registrations, schedules, and information about existing arrangements from the 2020 conference will be made available as soon as possible.  Questions and concerns can be directed to the Executive Committee via IASSIST President Sandra Cannon.

***(March 20, 2020)***

It is with heavy hearts that the IASSIST Executive, Local Arrangements, and Program committees announce that IASSIST 2020 will not happen. Given these unsettled times, the health and safety of our community is paramount.-->

<!--We are pleased to announce that the 20-21 conference will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden 7-9 April 2021. We have started to plan how to move the 2020 conference to the new 2021 dates. Stay tuned for more information in May.

In the meantime, we encourage participants to take whatever steps are available to you to cancel or change your travel plans if you have not already done so. We'll be in touch with those who have already registered about how we will handle the registration fees.-->
