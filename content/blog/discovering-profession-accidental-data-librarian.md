A session at the Edinburgh conference addressed a topic that arose
earlier in the year on the IASSIST email discussion list about how
people prepare and enter the profession of data librarianship. In
general, is there a profession of data librarianship?An interesting
question was presented on the IASSIST email discussion list earlier this
year asking how one becomes a data librarian. Several people replied by
relating personal accounts about their entry into this profession. Out
of this discussion came the observation that many were 'accidental'
data librarians, that is, they had not pursued a career as a data
librarian but by happenstance discovered the profession.

This conversation was continued in a session at the Edinburgh
conference:

librarian](http://iassistdata.org/conferences/archive/2005?page=5)**.
Speaking in this session, Paul Bern (Syracuse University) questioned
whether data librarianship qualifies as a real profession. He listed
three attributes that W.M. Sullivan in **[Work and
Integrity](http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0787974587.html)**
(2005) uses to characterize a profession:

-   a commitment to public service
-   public recognition of a degree of autonomy to regulate themselves
-   specialized training in a field of codified knowledge.

Paul noted that the first characteristic is one on which we clearly
qualify as a profession. Data librarians are known for their dedication
to public service. How data librarianship measures up to the next two
characteristics, however, is debatable. This blog entry is dedicated to
continuing this debate.
