So I had the best intentions to blog the conference but alas I was
distracted - creating my SecondLife avatar to be able to participate
virtually as well as in reality was far more interesting than I want to
admit!  My teenagers were appalled when they found out I was on Facebook - what will they say when I tell them about SusieQue!

As a technology-oriented association hosting a technology-themed
conference, it is maybe not surprising that we should experiment a bit. 
So the wonderful tech folks here at Stanford have created a virtual
world where avatars can watch the plenaries and have virtual cookies! 
My avatar is having a great time! <!--[](http://iassistblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/iassistsl.wmf)-->

The conference so far has been very interesting - what a fabulous job
the program committee did!  Of course their job was made easier by the
fantastic submissions that IASSISTERs provided!  I'll be canvassing
those at the conference (in real life!) to see if I can get more
detailed session reports to post.

Maybe next time we could also have a Turkey Action Group meeting in SL, eh?

Just want to echo Ann's sentiments -- it has been tremendous fun here in SL, and I look forward to being able to do this at future conferences I am unable to attend (hope that won't be very many!) -- Waldron Rhino

Alas.. I too have been distracted (today) by creating and getting acquainted with my new avatar and exploring the Stanford Libraries in SecondLife. It is beautiful here, and interesting, in both worlds.

Just want to say how grateful I am that those of us who are unable to be in Stanford can watch the plenaries and sessions taking place in the McCaw room, thanks to the support of the Stanford Second Life team. The sushi, tapas, cappuccino, IASSIST t-shirts, and camaraderie are great given the virtual state of things. We'll send snapshots so you all can see what we're experiencing there -- better yet, log in and join us. And the conference sounds -- and looks -- like the Best Ever. -- Ann Snoodle aka Green
