And another conference has passed. It's so sad to think that it will be
another year before we get together again but at least we can play
virtually on our lists, this blog and maybe even in SecondLife! I'm
still trying to round up more conference reports but in the meantime,
here's the official conference song lyrics. Sing to the tune of The
Band's song "The Weight"

In case the tune doesn't come to mind immediately, [here's a clip on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYQWCB4rkDI "The Weight") from
the movie "The Last Waltz". Hopefully we'll be able to scare up a
video of our own "Choral Memory Action Group" performance. Kudos to
composer and Action Group leader Melanie Wright for another fitting
closing tune!

Pulled into Frisco, was feeling ’bout half past dead<br />
Metadata schemas circling round my head<br />
Version 3 will fix that, the DDI man said<br />
Come to IASSIST with me, and at least you’ll be well fed!

Chorus<br />
Oh the Tech of Data<br />
Will set the data freeeee<br />
It’s the tech of Data<br />
And (and and and)<br />
IASSIST (IASSIST) is the place to be<br />

At the AC meeting, we talked of strategy<br />
And the workshops, 8 in all, took over the library<br />
Are you now or have ever been a cheese-eating monkey?<br />
It’s just amazing what you can do with version 3

Chorus

Plenary speaker, was she Catherine or was she Jo?<br />
All we know for certain is Steve’s her baby bro<br />
Lizza only talked to Tom: fellow data geeks, you know<br />
And in New Zealand it’s the sheep that run the show.

Mash-ups are mashtastic, may the data be with you<br />
Who’s the guy with the mohawk? oh it’s Walter and he’s blue!<br />
Ann Snoodle’s got a t-shirt, and look, there’s SusieQue<br />
Welcome SecondLifers to the crazy data crew

Chorus

Keep it simple stupid, whatcha need a BMW for?<br />
Arofan pushed SDMX and was greeted with a snore<br />
And the Finns asked will you need me, when I’m 64?<br />
Tried to make the 8-ball fall, and they almost broke the floor!
<br />
Torturing nurses with data can really be a blast<br />
And the Business Meeting has never gone so fast<br />
Don’t let Marilyn near it, if you want your machine to last<br />
Does that make Ekke Scrooge, Bo, if you’re the ghost of Christmas past?

Chorus

Banquet drumming wowed us, baby Taiko high five dude<br />
Potato-tinis and lots of other crazy food [is that port or pork?]<br />
From Johnny Cash to Brick House, the band got us in the mood<br />
Dual Turkey sessions meant we got our dose of crude

Now it’s nearly over, nearly time to say goodbye<br />
Ron, you’ve been so special, the standard you set is high<br />
San and Ellie can’t be beat, though Bo and Kate will try<br />
And we’ll see you all next year, when to Finland we will fly!

Oh the tech of data<br />
Will set the data freeeee<br />
It’s the tech of data<br />
and (and and and)<br />
IASSIST (IASSIST) is the place to be
