Melanie Wright and her doo-wop partners, Jen Green and Joanne Juhnke, treated us to this year's song at the wrap up session. These fine phrases should be set to the [tune of "My Girl"](http://www.thomas-distributing.com/midi/my_girl.mid)

There was sunshine after weeks of rain<br />
When the IASSISTers to Ann Arbor came<br />
Why have we come so far?<br />
What can drag us from the bar?<br />
Data (data) talkin’ ’bout data (data)

GIS, SDA and Atlas-TI<br />
Data lifecycles, and of course DDI<br />
in the Reading Room we made some noise<br />
and ogled gorgeous jazz band boys<br />
and data (data) always talkin’ ’bout data (data)

Atkins talked about cyberinfrastructures new<br />
Make your report title long enough, they’ll just call it after you.<br />
Europe won’t be left behind<br />
Unless the Commission changes its mind<br />
about data (data) infrastructure for data (data)

Oh those data librarians are accident prone<br />
With FEDORA and D-space, we’ll keep our digital objects at home.<br />
But not if Chuck has his way [GET OVER IT!]<br />
Data professionals will save the day<br />
And the data (data) we’ll save the data (data) oooh oooh

“INSTRUMENTAL” BRIDGE

Well we honoured heroes of our own<br />
With lifetime awards for Ilona and Tom<br />
It’s turtle time for Wendy T<br />
After 9 years with the Treasury<br />
And the data (data) always championing data (data)

The tornado raged blowing rain through the door<br />
Spyder rock and rolled, and we all hit the floor<br />
We ponied, bumped and did the Twist<br />
Walter put the Me back in IASSIST<br />
And the data (data) it’s all about [ME] data (data)

On Friday morning we talked about trust.<br />
Great discussions and talks closing pictures a must.<br />
There’d better be a good pool hall<br />
When we meet next year in Montreal<br />
Oh data (data) we’ll be talkin’ ’bout data (data)
