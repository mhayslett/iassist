**Research Data Infrastructure: Are the Social Sciences on Main Street
or a Side Road?

social sciences in the broader E-science picture and give us a glimpse
of the future.

The QuickTime .mov files are available in a variety of viewing formats:
via desktops, iPhone, iPod, iPad, smartphones.

We have had various and mixed reports on streaming successes. These are
large Video files (each over an Hour in length), so patience is
required.
