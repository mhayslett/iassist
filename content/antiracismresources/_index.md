## Anti-Racism Resources
<p>In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and  Ahmaud Arbery in 2020, among other (on-going) acts of violence against African Americans in the U.S., members of IASSIST felt compelled to gather materials that can help all of us better recognize, acknowledge and combat inherent racial bias. These members formed the Anti-Racism Resources Action Group in December of that year to compile the resources linked here.</p>

<p>Resources are grouped into two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Sources of data (in .csv format)](https://github.com/iassist/content/antiracismresources/datasources.csv) on a variety of topics but all documenting racism and the Black experience internationally.</li>
  <li>[Articles/toolkits/rubrics (in .csv format)](https://github.com/iassist/content/antiracismresources/arttoolkrubr.csv) for building anti-racism into the process of working with data across the research lifecycle. </li>
</ul>

<p>The group is also collecting essays to briefly summarize [varying national perspectives about collecting data by race] (https://github.com/iassist/content/antiracismresources/essays).</p>

<p>Finally, the Action Group is interested in co-sponsoring with IASSIST's Professional Development Committee (PDC) webinars on related topics such as different international approaches to/attitudes about race and discrimination; and/or, a panel of researchers to talk about the challenges of finding and/or cleaning/preparing/joining data on racial topics.</p>
  
<p>Please send suggestions for additions to the resources lists, and speakers (and topics) to the Action Group's co-chairs, Michele Hayslett, michele_hayslett [ at ] unc.edu and Nancy Kassam-Adams, ADAMSN [ at ] chop.edu.</p>

<p align="center">*Please note:  These resources will be reviewed periodically for their usage statistics.  When usage drops, these resources will be retired.*</p>
