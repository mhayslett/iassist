We consider activities that ensure that statistical and analytic claims about given data can be reproduced with that data, curating for reproducibility (CURE). This 3-hour workshop will teach participants practical strategies for curating research materials for reproducibility. The workshop will be based on the data quality review, a framework for helping ensure that research data are well documented and usable and that code executes properly and reproduces analytic results. The workshop will introduce three models for putting this framework into practice (the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) at Yale University, the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER), and the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). Participants will learn about the basic components of the CURE workflow using examples and hands-on activities. The workshop will also demonstrate a tool that structures the CURE workflow.",

Additionally, comparing this information to the treatments curators indicate are important, as well as the actual treatments they take locally, provides key insight into perceptions and practices related to data curation. Specifically, this information can tell us what stakeholders value in terms of curation and how this aligns with the local approach for curation services. To uncover this information, the Data Curation Network (DCN) used a mixed methods approach that included faculty focus groups, library surveys, and hands-on curation treatments. This panel will provide the detailed results and a comparative analysis of (1) both the importance of specific curatorial treatments from faculty and curator perspectives, and (2) the curation activities taking place at the six participating institutions, thus comparing perceived importance of curation activities to actual practices. This session will conclude with an audience discussion of the results, limitations of the information, and general project feedback.",

Following completion of the PISA 2015, the core skills assessment program was initiated to focus on the assessment based on Swiss measurement instruments to get more results with national relevance.Both programs are computer based assessments since 2016 but the IT systems for both programs are not yet optimized for supporting the fieldwork in an adequate manner. Therefore a software tool will be developed to support on the one hand the administration and the field monitoring during the data collection. On the other hand the idea is to optimize the data documentation process. In this presentation we would like to show which processes should be modeled and where documentation und metadata could be generated as a byproduct without additional effort. This includes in particular also paradata which provide interesting opportunities for analysis.",

                    "abstract": "The growing availability of mobile phones provides new opportunities for data collection, particularly in developing countries where it is challenging to reach respondents in rural areas. Text messaging or short message service (SMS) allows for high-frequency, automated data collection with large sample sizes at relatively low cost. However, the use of SMS technology also raises critical data quality issues, strongly suggesting the need for ongoing data management that can help evaluate robustness of responses over time, select appropriate tools for storage and data analysis and avoid dependency on specific platforms and standards.In this presentation we will discuss our approach to long-term management and preservation of mobile SMS survey data that are part of a larger project that examines adaptation of small-scale farmers in Africa to climate change. We will describe the development of an automated pipeline to ingest weekly data from a cloud-based platform to local data servers, while maintaining security and confidentiality. We will also demonstrate tools to enhance survey metadata and monitor and visualize data health and trends. The audience will be invited to discuss how robust data management can serve both the needs of the research team and the needs of potential data users and stakeholders.",

There is often no blueprint on how to best develop and program these complex experimental studies; most are undertaken precisely because they have not been done before. However, innovation in experimental data collection often comes at the expense of the ability to use established methods and tools to compile metadata and paradata. Thus, the programmers who decide how to develop the code and programs used to administer the experiments also have considerable discretion in how to collect and compile the associated data and metadata. We will describe our experiences with developing complex human subjects research experiments and how adopting good practices in metadata and data management has improved the quality of our research support.",

                    "abstract": "While data-driven research has always required training and a complex understanding of methodologies and epistemologies, the environment for data services in research libraries seems to be growing increasingly turbulent. The demand for data instruction is widening to all disciplines. Even disciplines that have strong traditions in data creation and analysis are experiencing methodological crises. Tools and best practices change rapidly and make it difficult to maintain a stable curriculum for instruction. Finally, the librarians and staff who provide data services are often doing so in an environment where they have to divide their time between many different types of services and where resources for professional development are limited.In this panel, librarians and staff in different data services positions will present briefly on their experiences addressing the complexities of the current data instruction environment, including teaching about data management, data gathering/creation, data cleaning and analysis, and data visualization.nbsp; The panel chair will then lead a discussion between the panelists and audience to explore other challenges and opportunities in this area. A recorder will capture discussion and resources in an openly accessible document that can serve as a resource for data services staff moving forward.",

                    "abstract": "Graduate programs in the social sciences aim to produce well rounded scholars and researchers. Although the majority of these programs offer curriculum in research methods and data collection as well as provide opportunities for professional development it is less clear how many students leave graduate school with a background in data management and data sharing.For each social science discipline, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, geography, and history, their ethical codes necessitate open and accessible data. This is crucial as research becomes more collaborative, and evidence suggests that the research culture can be a barrier to data sharing. Early training in data management and sharing could help alleviate this problem.The current study assesses how masters and doctoral level programs in the social sciences include formal and informal training in data sharing and the use of data repositories. We developed a survey instrument to measure the extent to which programs are likely to provide this training using a mix of open and closed ended questions. We sent the survey to 30 programs in the United States across the six social science disciplines. We report on our results and discuss implications for developing training materials that can be used in graduate programs.",

Over the last few years, most universities and research institutes have developed research data management policies. Many institutions want to offer a repository service to the staff of their institution for storing and sharing research data. University libraries or other university departments usually want to have the control of such a repository solution.nbsp;To meet this demand, we started working according to a front-office, back-office model. A practical implementation of this is DataverseNL, built upon software developed by Harvard University (IQSS). DataverseNL is a shared service provided by the participating institutions and DANS. DANS performs back-office tasks, including server and software maintenance and administrative support. The participating institutions are responsible for managing the content, the data deposited by their staff. The repositories (or dataverses) within DataverseNL are positioned for data storage and sharing during research and about ten years after the conclusion of a research project. With a SWORD interface to EASY, long-term archiving is secured. In this presentation, we will focus on future developments like data tagging for privacy-sensitive data, visualization of data and building Virtual Research Environments within DataverseNL.",

By bringing the ideas of the DSA and FAIR together, we will be able to offer an operationalization that can be implemented in any Trustworthy Digital Repository.nbsp;In 2014 the FAIR Principles were formulated. The well-chosen FAIR acronym is attractive: it almost automatically gets stuck in your mind once you have heard it. In a relatively short term, the FAIR data principles have been adopted by many stakeholders, including research funders.The FAIR principles are remarkably similar to the underlying principles of DSA (2005): the data can be found on the Internet, are accessible, in a usable format, reliable and are identified in a unique and persistent. The DSA presents quality criteria for repositories, whereas the FAIR principles target individual datasets. The two sets of principles will be discussed and compared and a tangible operationalization will be presented.",

Our in-house research relies on the analysis of patient level data, which can provide insights into health utilisation and outcomes. It is important for any organisation processing patient information to be able to keep these data safe, and demonstrate this to data providers.This paper discusses the application of the \u20185 Safes framework\u2019 in health services research. This framework provides guidance in risk mitigation when using health records, whether in aggregated form, fully identifiable or when de-identified. Fundamental to the framework is creating an appropriate balance of controls in all five dimensions of safe data access (safe data, safe people, safe projects, safe settings and safe outputs).The Health Foundation applies this framework in the designing and operating of its secure data environment. Combined with active data provider engagement, and adherence to national and international standard of best practice, the secure data environment enables the safe processing of de-identified patient\u2019s medical records linked across various health care services in the United Kingdom.",

There are established ways to automatically scan for information like Social Security or Credit Card numbers and best practices exist for de-identifying or masking variables which could reveal identity. However, there are many other laws and policies which restrict the publishing of certain types of data including information about endangered animals and protected areas. More awareness of the less common types of restricted data is needed among researchers and data management professionals. The national trend toward interdisciplinary research programs makes it more likely that a single researcher will lack a complete knowledge of applicable laws. This paper will discuss the research taking place to create a database of sensitive information types along with corresponding laws restricting that information and suggestions for identifying each of those data types.",

This requirement makes collaborating with colleagues at the same institution difficult; moreover, it makes collaborating across institutions practically impossible.The challenge is to provide a platform that facilitates collaboration while also meeting security requirements.nbsp; Cloud computing with virtualized machines can meet these challenges.nbsp; nbsp;Virtual machines can be configured to prevent them from accessing the Internet so that researchers cannot copy files to a server on the Internet.nbsp; nbsp;With virtual environment, implementing vetting of output by authorized reviewers can easily be incorporated into the protocols.nbsp; nbsp;Researchers from different institutions can access the virtual machines in the cloud and have access to shared project resources and files.Virtual environments have been recognized for their security.nbsp; The most important feature of this type of virtual environment is that the restricted-use data never leave the system. Access to the data may be modified instantly.nbsp; When a data use agreement expires, access can be immediately terminated. Another facet is controlling output so that it can be vetted for disclosure risk.nbsp; nbsp;In addition to these security controls, virtual environments can be setup with common disk space for projects. This disk space is a way for researcher at different location to collaborate.nbsp; Since this space is within the virtual environment, it meets security requirements.",

Following on from reviews of this scheme and of data that fall within its remit, there have been changes to the mechanisms by which the UK Data Service provides access to these data sources. These changes relate to the process of gaining permission to access data, and to a statistical disclosure review of the licences under which sensitive variables are held. Using these reviews as exemplars, this presentation will discuss how the impact of the changes affects the operation of the UK Data Service (in acquisition, licensing, ingest, access, and support) and how the user experience is altered in parallel. This exercise demonstrates the value of working closely with data depositors at all stages of the data lifecycle to strike a balance between preserving data security and ensuring that sensitive information can be shared safely and practically for legitimate research needs. As legislation and attitudes evolve to encompass new forms of data, there will be a continuing need for data producers and data services to provide dynamic responses to new developments.",

IASSIST is an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching. Membership in CODATA is country and scientific union based while IASSIST is made up of individual memberships.nbsp; In spite of these differences in organizational structure, the focus on technology in support of data stewardship and on capacity-building are shared strategic directions of both organizations. A current proposal to merge the International Social Science Council (ISSC) with ICSU has the potential to bring IASSIST and CODATA even closer together in mission. This presentation will update the audience on the merger process and will outline the strategic directions and recent achievements of CODATA. It will conclude by identifying new doors in data development and service that could be opened by working more closely with CODATA.

But there is another campus perspective on managing data. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) ethics compliance professionals have a different view on data management. Data management perspectives come from data usability and re-usability. The RCR perspective draws from government ethics regulations such as human subjects/IRB guidelines and other ethical protocols. Even though views of data ethics inform lifecycle data management, when the two points of view get to details they have very different perspectives.This presentation will share what happens when scholarly communications and RCRnbsp; professionals realize they have these very different ideas of what data management means. If you come to this session, you\u2019ll learn how we harmonized the two views to build a local partnership around our common language of ethics and data. The shared understanding we built underpins our shared \"ethical management of data\" workshop. The harmonized workshop lets us have double the reach as we co-teach to audiences whether they are interested in ethics or data.",

                    "abstract": "The Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) is a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) program that measures how US families spend their money. These data are also input to the CPI. BLS selected DDI-3.2 to document CE, including the entire life-cycle.CE is conducted as 2 separate surveys, Interview and Diary. The data are combined during processing and packaged in 2 ways, one for CE dissemination and one for CPI. Changes in design occur every odd numbered year. Yearly estimates are created every 6 months, PUMD issued yearly, and data sent to CPI monthly. CE processing is divided into 4 sub-systems: 1) sample selection and collection; 2) initial edit subsystem; 3) estimation and edit subsystem, with data sent to CPI; and 4) final edits, tables, microdata. Data are processed in packages by expenditure type.A documentation system needs to handle all these features. For development, BLS is conducting a phased approach, adding complexity from phase to phase. The incremental systems are designed to establish that DDI and the Colectica system are sufficiently sophisticated to account for each feature of CE. This paper will go into detail about the particulars of the CE survey, describe progress made, and plans for the future.",

We could not identify a similar plugin for datasets. We reviewed all active contracts and open data sources for publication permissions, restrictions or limitations, post-termination rights, and specific data citation guidelines. Information was then compiled and made available on a private intranet site to avoid violation of non-disclosure agreements. Citation information was translated into LaTex scripting in Modified Chicago Style when specific citation requirements were not indicated by the Licensor. This poster will explain that process and provide a template for data citations and their LaTex scripting.",

While we initially held no more than 200 datasets being used by a maximum of 10 users per year, we currently hold over 1900 deposited datasets, with a data usage count of approximately 2900 per year. One of our major initiatives in promoting such data use includes Secondary Analysis Workshops, which are held to encourage researchers and graduate students in social sciences to make the best use of the survey data kept in our archive. We seek participants and research themes from all over Japan and analyze the target datasets every year. Researchers from depository institutions who are knowledgeable about the data serve as advisors for the workshops. SSJDA staff also support the workshops as they provide expertise in social research and quantitative data analysis. Through these efforts, participants are able to work together to pursue their own research agenda, as they receive advice on the characteristics of the data as well as on choosing methodologies. The number of participants and research themes for the workshops have been increasing each year, suggesting that such initiatives are highly regarded by Japanese researchers and graduate students in social sciences.",

We know that the recipe is heavy on metadata.nbsp;But there are other ingredients too, and even the ripest data need to be carefully prepared for preservation. Furthermore, without the right tools and a cool, dry place for storage, the mission is in jeopardy from the beginning.This poster highlights the recent progress of the Finnish Social Science Data Archive. We run an institutional data repository, but have in a systematic way been preparing our collection for sustainable long-term preservation by taking advantage of an emerging national long-term preservation solution.There are four major, partly parallel, areas for development:1) Choosing sustainable file formats, migrating existing content, and updating data processing policies and software accordingly.2) Producing software for harvesting rich metadata and wrapping it with the data and contextual files into a METS container for transfer.3) Influencing to the adoption of national standards and services.4) Training the staff and administrative tasksBetter data management, increased trustworthiness and automated processes should allow us to allocate more human resources to other critical software development and data services. Our effort focuses on traditional social science data; data matrices, code and textual materials. However, the principles accepted can be adopted by other disciplines as well, given that the formats are the same. The work has been carried out in collaboration with the National Digital Library Initiative.",

MEIRU runs a health research programme encompassing a rural site in northern Malawi and an urban site in the capital city of Malawi Lilongwe.nbsp; It has a rich collection of longitudinal data dating to as early as 1979. Work is now underway to convert the vast unstructured documentation into DDI codebook format for data sharing with researchers outside the project. I relate my education background and prior work experience to my current work as a metadata officer. I identify parallels and differences between my current and former jobs and highlight areas where training and closer supervision are required to strengthen my capacity. I finally attempt to identify opportunities for capturing metadata during the field work phase to reduce confusion down the line when the data are being prepared for sharing. The perspectives shared here could be of use to researchers working on projects similar to MEIRU and also to DDI developers who will see how we are implementing the specification in our settings. I am holding a Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE), Certificate Computing and Information Systems (CIS)",

SHARE builds its free, open, data set (https://share.osf.io/) by gathering, cleaning, linking, and enhancing metadata that describe research activities and outputs\u2014from data management plans and grant proposals to research data and code, to preprints, presentations, and journal articles.nbsp;In this workshop, participants will learn to use the OSF to develop embedded data stewardship and research management services for faculty. Attendees will also learn how to leverage and enhance SHARE data to improve their institutions\u2019 understanding of the whole scholarship ecosystem happening on their campuses.This workshop will be divided into two parts. First, attendees will learn strategies to provide curation and research services to the faculty workflow by operating in the OSF. Practical approaches to faculty collaborations and curation assistance throughout the research life cycle will be discussed. The second part will focus on harnessing the power of the SHARE data set to discover and act upon the research outputs of an institution or organization. This hands-on portion of the workshop will use IPython/Jupyter Notebooks to access the SHARE API and search across 129+ different providers and export and clean the metadata.nbsp;Participants are encouraged to bring laptops in order to follow along. No previous programming experience is necessary.",

Occasionally videos have factual errors confusing descriptive and structural metadata concepts or present too much information too quickly for people to understand well.The \u201c5 Minute Metadata\u201d videos are a new take on how to introduce metadata to people in a non-confronting way, whether they are a seasoned data expert or are completely new to the concept. These videos are a way to improve metadata literacy by meeting people half way, because they might have heard about metadata but are be unsure of what it is, like the differences between descriptive and structural metadata.

The openly accessible results of the study (link forthcoming) demonstrates the current state of data curation services in ARL institutions by addressing the current infrastructure (policy and technical) at ARL member institutions for data curation, treatment activities, the current level of demand for data curation services, and the frequency for how often specialized curatorial actions are taken. This poster dives deeper into the qualitative responses and analyzes the trends and challenges that institutions are currently facing when providing data curation services. As libraries seek to define their mission and service levels in support of data curation activities, having an understanding of the challenges that other institutions face in supporting this effort will be essential. Finally the poster will describe how the current partner institutions of the Data Curation Network will use the results of this survey to gain a more extensive understanding of the curation ecosystem beyond ARL institutions.",

However, we don\u2019t yet have a solid understanding of how research teams incorporate (or not) documentation into their everyday work. This poster reports on a project to investigate, analyze, and synthesize real and ideal documentation practices within research teams in order to develop a universal project manual documentation template. It is our contention that a \u201clab manual\u201d or \u201cproject organization protocol\u201d will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of research teams, while creating an inclusive environment by making local practices and expectations clear to all team members regardless of previous research experience and disciplinary background.

Under a complex and dynamic data sharing legal framework in the UK, the Network is a partnership of UK Universities, government departments, national statistical authorities, funders and research centres and it aims to deliver a service enabling secure and lawful access to de-identified linked administrative data to researchers.nbsp;As one of the 'front doors' to the ADRN, the Administrative Data Service is liaising with data owners, researchers and experts in data linkage and data governance to facilitate access to administrative data. In addition to providing guidance on processes and an infrastructure addressing some of the concerns on information governance and data security through dedicated 'secure environments' as points of access. Quite often, we find ourselves in the \u2018middle\u2019 of these discussions, as we negotiate access and translate requirements and repurpose documentation to ensure the project resonates with a variety of agendas and priorities.nbsp;The poster will provide an overview of recent work in the area and how we have dealt with challenges up to now. We will summarise work done in trying to streamline application processes for different data providers in different data domains in the UK (e.g. education, health, crime, benefits and labour market). We will talk about how ADRN has been working alongside government departments to design and implement streamlined approaches to administrative data access in the UK and how we are supporting researchers when they apply to access administrative data for their research in the areas of ethics, consent, legal pathways to access, methodology and data availability. And how it\u2019s not just about data meeting in the middle, it\u2019s primarily about people.",

The Data Facility at NYU\u2019s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is building on a long history of research on how to facilitate data curation, ingestion, storage, and controlled access in a safe and trustworthy environment. The poster describes how CUSP combines computer science, information science, and social science approaches which include (i) building a data model that accommodates sharing research data across disciplines, (ii) employing data curation and ingestion services so that data providers can confidently share their data with authorized researchers, (iii) converting data restrictions into concise, easy to understand, and searchable metadata to help researchers find appropriate data for their research, and (iv) capturing activity around datasets as contextual metadata so researchers can discover new data to complement their analyses.",

Business models encompass financial structures such as revenue streams and costs, but also relationships (contractual, partnerships etc.), mission decisions about who to serve, and collections decisions about what to maintain.nbsp;This poster is part of a larger project about how social science data archives have adapted over long periods of time and to variety of challenges.nbsp; nbsp;nbsp;We will include data on changes in business models at four prominent and long-lived social science data archives, ICPSR at University of Michigan, the UKDA, part of the UK Data Service at University of Essex, the LIS Cross National Data Center in Luxembourg, and EDINA at the University of Edinburgh. Our data include historical institutional documents and interviews with current and past staff.",

New users typically must spend their time installing, configuring, and learning the programming conventions of specific software environments that may themselves present barriers of cost and compatibility. Importing and wrangling data into a form suitable for use is another barrier.As data professionals, we can apply our skills to develop relatively painless introductions to data that focus on understanding the data itself and analytical concepts, instead of the mechanics of a program.nbsp; We can customize and tailor our presentations to the needs of particular audiences by developing wrappers around data and functions that simplify their use, and we can develop techniques and interfaces that allow easy data exploration.Using R, this workshop will explore 1) building packages for distributing data and functions; 2) using sample data and functions to illustrate basic data literacy concepts such as descriptive statistics, modeling, and visualization, while keeping the focus on meaning, not mechanics; and 3) building tools for interactive exploratory data analysis by end users.nbsp; As open source software, R is easily available and can be locally distributed where internet access and computing resources are scarce.Note that workshop attendees will need to provide their own laptop. The workshop leaders will contact attendees with instructions for downloading software (R, version 3.3 or later, download from https://cloud.r-project.org and RStudio, version 1.0 or laterdownload from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) prior to the workshop date and attendees are also welcome to arrive 15 minutes early for help with software installation.",

Consequently, qualitative researchers are increasingly turning to computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) to facilitate their analyses. Through hands-on work with provided data, participants will explore ways to organize, analyze, and present qualitative research using both NVivo and Atlas.ti analysis softwares. The workshop will cover the following topics:\u2022 Coding of text and multimedia sources\u2022 Using Queries to explore and code data\u2022 Organizing and classifying sources to facilitate comparative analyses across data characteristics (e.g. demographics)\u2022 Data visualizations and reportsNote that workshop attendees will need to provide their own laptop running Windows or Windows virtual desktop (for Macs). The workshop leaders will contact attendees with instructions for downloading free trial versions of Atlas.ti and NVivo for installation prior to the workshop date.This workshop is sponsored by the Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG).",

We\u2019ll cover topics designed to get new users acclimated to the technology and mapping on their own.We will cover basic and intermediate GIS topics. Basic topics include general mapping concepts, data requirements, useful GIS data repositories, and how to load those data into QGIS. Intermediate topics will cover types of GIS data visualizations, data manipulation techniques, and basic analyses.This is a hands-on session that will introduce participants to the fun and ease of map making. Participants will leave with practical skills, free resources, and a well-developed understanding of GIS principles.Note that workshop attendees will need to provide their own laptop.

They will describe the current state of their back end data services infrastructure while highlighting best practices in terms of providing front end research data management services for their campus community. Specifically, the panelists will outline their front end research data management services such as providing workshops, online guides and tutorials, as well as providing research consultations and referrals. The panel discussion will provide time at the end of the session for questions and answers with the audience.",

However, this understanding can be diminished by the continued marginalization and isolation of data from the larger realm of information. In reaction to these contradictory messages, this presentation focuses on refinements to library instruction that promote the perception of data as an integral component of information-seeking, rather than perpetuating the message that data represent a specialized domain of knowledge.By purposefully infusing data resources into library instruction, students are better equipped to advance critical thinking skills, and synthesize and apply information within and across disciplines. Inspired by the conference theme\u2014and with a particular emphasis on connecting with learners who are not data specialists\u2014this presentation will illustrate how pop culture references, humor, and low-tech instruction techniques can be employed to find the middle ground that will result in an engaging and stimulating instruction session.",

The presentation will approach KM in a global context that is appropriate for and relevant to a wide-range of environments within the social and information sciences. The intended audience for this session is librarians, archivists, researchers, managers, educators, and other professionals who deal with and/or would like to understand more about social sciences data management through a KM perspective. The presentation assumes little to no prior knowledge of KM and, therefore, is widely accessible for all interested attendees.",

Better mobilization of urban health workers to serve remote or underserved areas as a strategy to improve access to health information to the population in remote and rural areas (WHO, 2012). The outreach services goal of Outreach activities of Statistics Canada is to generate interest and add value to their products and services. This has been achieved by publicizing official statistics not only to increase public awareness, understanding and use data, but also to generate interest and encourage greater numbers of businesses and individuals to answer the agency's surveys (Statistics Canada, 2014).nbsp;This paper examines the challenges Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) faces in providing outreach services to data users in Uganda.nbsp; The objectives of the study were: to examine the outreach services provided by UBOS, the challenges they face in providing the services and proposals for enhancing outreach services to the data users. A total of 10 respondents in UBOS charged with providing outreach services.nbsp;An online questionnaires, and interviews were used to collect data from UBOS staff for this research. The study found out that UBOS provides a number of outreach services to its data users to include exhibitions, school outreach programme, training etc. however, it faces challenges of inadequate funding to finance the initiatives and translate the information into local languages. The study therefore proposes as an institution, UBOS needs to prioritize or allocate funding for the outreach services for it fully achieve its mandate.",

Under the guidance of its inaugural Director, Chuck Humphrey, the broad goals within this mandate are two-fold: 1) to develop a robust pan-Canadian network of Research Data Management (RDM) expertise; and 2) connecting essential infrastructure and service components needed for RDM, and a national preservation and discovery network. There are currently six active Portage Expert Groups, including one focused upon the development of RDM training in Canada. This presentation will focus upon three key deliverables undertaken by the group: 1) an environmental scan to identify existing RDM resources and tools which may be leveraged; 2) a White Paper that identifies international training activities, gaps in RDM training in Canada, and a high-level view for a national RDM training program for various stakeholders; and 3) the development and delivery of a national RDM training program. Current status of deliverables, lessons learned, and forward work will be discussed.",

The aim is to demonstrate the value of improved data infrastructure, enabling collection and analysis of data which is of interest to civil society organisations and empowering the sector to better use its own data.nbsp;All three strands aim to enable research in social sciences while safeguarding individuals\u2019 identities.nbsp; Working in a diverse changing landscape brings its own challenges and possibilities.nbsp; The University of Essex hosts the Administrative Data Service of the ADRN, the Business and Local Government Data Centre and the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project.nbsp; The challenge is to describe the boundaries, overlaps and synergies in the landscape.nbsp;This paper will review the UK network of these partnerships, a description of some of the challenges of taking part in such a diverse growing landscape and some of the benefits to researchers and society.",

Long-term data preservation is critical for future reproducibility of economic research. A greater focus is being placed on making research data publicly available, but there is a dearth of official policies and discussion in the literature concerning preservation. A sampling of about 250 economics journals was developed by cross-referencing journal impact factors, h5-indices, IDEAS rankings, and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City staff authorship and service to the journal. This sampling analyzes whether data preservation policies are present either independently or as part of a larger data availability policy. Preliminary results indicate that while data availability policies are becoming much more common, data preservation policies are practically nonexistent. This has strong implications for future research reproducibility. In response, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is developing an institutional data preservation platform as an alternative solution.",

The Research Data Journal contains short publications (data papers) in which researchers describe their dataset: the context of their investigation of the problem and methods used. This is followed by an overall profile of the dataset, for example in terms of general characteristics or remarkable results. Conclusions as an ordinary scientific paper are not required, but there is room for concluding remarks. Readers can respond via a comments field to the content. The data must be deposited in a trusted repository, such as via DANS or the UK Data Service.Data papers are a relatively new venture for the humanities and social sciences, and we have had to work hard to show potential authors the value of them as a valuable output, to complement not only their own research publications, but to promote their published datasets.

After presenting initial descriptive results at IASSIST2016, we now provide some more in-depth analysis. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has proved to be a powerful approach to better understand human behavior. Therefore, the survey was conducted with the aim to identify possible factors that can affect researchers\u00b4 behavior towards data sharing in terms of three aspects: attitude towards data sharing, perceived social norm and perceived behavioral control. The data was analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to outline the role of TPB and to explain data sharing in the social sciences.",

Each of those processes needs to be supported by a specialized software. Thereby the quality of data and efficiency of research is heavily depending on the software used and the interoperability of different software products. A variety of products often leads to complications during the Research Data Life Cycle. Different formats and standards, proprietary code, and sometimes the lack of appropriate and user friendly software at all make it hard and sometimes impossible to create and maintain efficient Research Data Life Cycle processes. The recommendation of a Tool Chain to support the complete process aims on solving those challenges. Build on Open Source and with interoperability in mind different software modules focus on different process within the life cycle. The paper first describes the different processes within the Research Data Life Cycle, afterwards names appropriate tools or shows blank spaces in the overall workflow and closes with a summary of important best practice procedures needed to fulfil the requirements of a real Tool Chain.",

As researchers strive to make their work more transparent, open, and reproducible, more tools are being developed to support these efforts. The analysis workflow in particular is one part of the research lifecycle that stands to benefit most from these developments. This presentation will describe how researchers can integrate better data management and reproducibility into their analyses using new extensions in R, a popular tool for statistical computing. These extensions include new support for a variety of tasks, such as file directory management (R Projects), version control and sharing (Git/Github interfaces), reproducible reports (knitr), project portability and longevity (Packrat), as well as visualization and data wrangling (Tidyverse).",

What is the balance of training opportunities on specific visualization tools versus more general approaches? This presentation will delve into these and other questions.",

To better help them with their culminating senior projects, and assist their faculty, the Library is building a team of undergraduate student assistants. They help their fellow students find data, wrangle it into a form compatible with Stata, and then use it with Stata. When developing the team, the Library looked to examples from other college and university libraries. Since Dartmouth does not offer a Ph.D. in Economics or in Business, who are frequently used as consultants elsewhere, we look to undergraduates for providing consultation.nbsp; Indirectly, this program has proven to be a very effective form of outreach to both students and faculty. Directly, even at this early stage the program is successful on multiple levels. Students feel comfortable working with other students, and they can meet on evenings or week-ends when Librarians are unavailable. With the Library handling many of the data and basic Stata questions, faculty are given more time with students to focus on in-depth questions about econometric methodology. Perks for student assistants include advanced training in databases such as Bloomberg, an attractive skill to employers.",

In this panel, Mandy Swygart-Hobaugh introduces how qualitative social science and humanities researchers may feel \u201cstuck in the middle\u201d between more quantitative disciplines, and how the language of data can help build bridges across disciplines and methodological approaches. Lynda Kellam discusses efforts to work with historians to apply principles of research \"data\" management to archival work. She discusses her efforts to develop and promote best practices with the history graduate students at UNCG, who use non-numerical data, such as PDFs, images etc. Louise Corti addresses disciplinary bridging, showing how older qualitative data, from the 1960s, is being used by social historians, firmly established as a humanities resource. She introduces her collaborative project with humanities scholars looking at automating the publishing of recorded oral histories. Sebastian Karcher and Dessislava Kirilova discuss the recent transparency agenda in the social science and humanities and what this means for different types of qualitative data. They draw on examples from political science and QDR to consider potential solutions for open science, such as the use of Annotation for Transparent Inquiry.",

All research data available at GESIS are accessible via the Data Catalogue DBK (http://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/). After registering with the service most of the data is directly downloadable, the rest can be ordered. Predominant data formats provided are SPSS or STATA, and others may only be obtained on request. While this service is well established, it may not be suited for more advanced research use cases like data linking or automatically crawling data in interdisciplinary settings. Also for archiving purposes a vendor independent data format based on Unicode format CSV files would be preferable. Thus, a generic procedure for converting all archived SPSS datasets was developed, tested, and applied to the majority of SPSS datasets in the archive. These Unicode format datasets are now available for download to researchers. Additionally, an open API was developed to give registered users the possibility of directly accessing the data. The system uses the OpenAPI specification (https://www.openapis.org/), a vendor neutral description format for RESTful APIs. This new service enables researchers to do advanced data analysis respecting current access restrictions.",

But, building small institutional data repositories with limited resources and staff has not been an attractive solution to most. At the same time, the need continues to grow for locally supporting faculty\u2019s data management, data storage, archiving, and other research needs with locally managed solutions. As data professionals at small institutions consider options like Dataverse, the following questions arise: (1) what unmet faculty data needs exist at these smaller institutions? (2) how may the Dataverse application provide support for those these needs? (3) what needs might NOT be supported by Dataverse? (4) how do we gauge the community\u2019s readiness for considering Dataverse as a solution? (4) what are the alternatives?nbsp; This panel will discuss collected responses to these questions from information professionals within the Oberlin Group, hear from a Dataverse representative at the Odum Institute, reflect on local experiences, and encourage the sharing of similar ideas and experiences among attendees.",

Through the use of UML (Unified Modeling Language), a  software independent representation of DDI is being developed and  maintained. Compatibility with the older versions of DDI, DDI 2.x  (Codebook) and DDI 3.x (Lifecycle), is a requirement. So, XML and RDF  bindings to the UML model are being developed. DDI Views (DDI4) includes a Codebook View which can be used to  describe the logical and physical structure of a variety of data files  along with information supporting both discovery and understanding of  the data. This presentation shows the use of this view to describe  examples of a dataset written in CSV and fixed column layouts.   The presentation will include a brief tour of the DDI Views model,  descriptions of the classes and attributes of a simple codebook, and  examples of the XML used to describe each type of file.

                    "abstract": "The DDI Moving Forward program was established in 2012 to move DDI to  the next generation of development. Over a series of face to face and  online meetings, the Alliance has been establishing the next phase of  DDI - the move from an XML standard to a model-based standard. The  effort involves developing not only the information model, but also the  infrastructure for building that model, the transformation into a set of  representations (initially XML schema and RDF/OWL), and the associated  documentation.  The first two releases of the DDI Moving Forward program, known  as DDI-Views, have now been publicly released, and the work program is  now moving into development of core content areas for the DDI community.  This panel will provide an overview of the new content released as part  of the work program, applications of the new content, and the  production framework and tools used in development and management of the  standard. Papers include:  - An introduction to the model-based approach (Achim Wackerow)  - The Data Description, Data Capture and Codebook packages (Dan Gillman, Jay Greenfield, Barry Radler)  - Applications of in statistical production and health (Jay Greenfield, Dan Gillman)  - Production systems and tools (Larry Hoyle, Achim Wackerow)",

                    "abstract": "Founded in 1995, the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) has been used  by the international social science research community to describe data.  Over those years, individuals and organizations have made strides in  both evolving the standard and developing DDI based tools, with a goal  of enabling efficient metadata creation and exchange across the life  cycle. How can we build on these successes, adapt to a changing  environment, and achieve better integration? The answer: a new vision  for a large-scale distributed infrastructure for all empirical social  science research based on DDI. This interactive panel will present the DDI Alliance\u2019s proposed  vision for infrastructure and invite attendees to engage and participate  in discussing and developing the plan. Topics discussed will include:  proposed tools (e.g., questionnaire element registry, datum-level data  storage, interoperability with other metadata standards), funding  opportunities, engaging with other stakeholders, and strategies for  achieving the vision. This is a working draft of an iterative process  started by a working group in the DDI Moving Forward workshop in  Dagstuhl in October 2016. Join this unique opportunity for participants  in the data life cycle to discuss how collaboratively develop a more  robust environment for research.nbsp;",

The System licenses a wide variety of proprietary databases for use in economic research. Cataloging economic databases as if they were bibliographic electronic resources has been met with limited success. Beyond connecting users with the data, we also need to provide relevant supplemental materials and the terms of use. Many academic libraries use LibGuides or provide a single list of data resources, but what do users really want?nbsp; How can we deliver all the necessary information in an easy-to-use solution? Where will users look to learn about data resources available to them? What specific information do they need to know? To answer these questions, a series of interviews will be conducted with data users to identify specific ways we can better communicate data resource availability as well as the terms of use. Based on conversations with users, the most productive interview questions will be compiled into a script for future outreach. This presentation will give an overview of the problem, the results of our interviews, and a script that librarians can use to gather user feedback.",

Many pioneering areas of research are advanced by using these highly sensitive data. RDC use is on the rise, also due to the growing range of new data available exclusively via this route.nbsp;One of the foundations of RDCs is the concept of safe outputs whereby results of analysis, undertaken within secure environments, are only released once they have passed a thorough Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC).nbsp; However, SDC checks can be time and labour-intensive.nbsp; Therefore, a challenge for many RDCs is to make the process of output checking more efficient while retaining the rigour of disclosure control and excellent service for users.This panel session will feature three RDCs based in the UK, Germany and the United States of America, and how they tackle those challenges using methods such as automation, evaluation techniques, managing throughput, and working with data owners.nbsp; Panellists will present their local innovations and discuss how providers internationally can learn from each other in advancing services in this area.",

This 'offer' has presented some unique challenges for the Administrative Data Service - the section of the ADRN which has led many of the discussions with UK government departments - and has created a mix of responsibilities and expectations between User and Service which are different from those experienced by many, traditional, data access services.This presentation will outline: 1) why the ADRN model was adopted and how it was useful in the context of the service, 2) the challenges that became apparent when ADRN began to operate \u2013 and the difficulties that were experienced because of the working model and 3) the solutions that the service put in place to enable effective user support and management in a highly challenging environment (as well as some of the blue-sky thinking that we\u2019ve done about the ideal solutions for the future).

                    "abstract": "An original data collection effort is often conducted by a scientist or group of scientists representing a single discipline. While secondary analysis of that data may occur within the same field, researchers from additional disciplines may also become interested in the data as well, creating a diffusion of the data across disciplinary boundaries. This paper investigates this idea using datasets archived in the Civic Learning, Engagement, and Action Data Sharing project at ICPSR. We compare the disciplines of the original researcher(s) involved in a data collection to the disciplines of researchers who have published findings based on analyses of these same datasets. Our analysis shows how some data become utilized by diverse disciplines over time. The paper also describes the extent to which researchers collaborate across disciplines in producing and analyzing data. Finally, we examine whether characteristics of the data (such as the breadth of the data) lead to greater diffusion across disciplinary boundaries. We conclude by discussing the value of sharing and using archival data across disciplinary boundaries.",

                    "abstract": "Widely used across disciplines such as natural resources, social sciences, public health, humanities, and economics, spatial data (digital maps) are an important component in many studies and have promoted interdisciplinary research development. Though institutional data repository provides a great solution for data curation, preservation, and sharing, it usually lacks the spatial visualization capability which limits the use of spatial data to professionals. To increase the impact of research generated spatial data, and truly turn them into digital maps for a broader user base, we have developed the workflow and cyberinfrastructure to extend the current capability of our institutional data repository. In this project, spatial data are curated and preserved in the data repository, as well as shared as map services using GIS server. Data visualization was created to ensure general information users can browse maps to find location-based information. Data download option, metadata and DOI allow researchers to identify, cite, and reuse the datasets. In addition, these data are ingested into the spatial data portal to increase the discoverability for spatial information users. Initial usage statistics suggest that this cyberinfrastructure has greatly improved the spatial data usage and extended the institutional data repository to facilitate spatial data sharing.",

A key challenge for the scientific community is to access and integrate data from diverse disciplines, which have traditionally collected or obtained data for very different units of analysis, on widely varying spatial and temporal scales, and using discipline-focused terminology and measurement frameworks. We highlight a number of examples of how the scientific community has integrated satellite-based remote sensing data with various types of socioeconomic data, ranging from simple visualization to statistical models to process-based simulation models. Geospatial tools and methods are often one way in which socioeconomic and remote sensing data can be integrated. We analyze published studies that cite both remote sensing and social science data to identify the ways in which data are transformed and used together and to assess what barriers and challenges users typically must overcome to achieve their objectives.",

The pedagogical method embraces both service learning and teaching to learn methodologies, capitalizes on developing solutions to \"real world needs\", rather than strictly discipline specific needs. While seeking to foster the development of data focused services for one particular department, we are able to reverse engineer services and a curriculum that are of interest to a wide variety of disciplines who are not traditionally seen as large users of data services.nbsp;nbsp;",

However, with some open-data portals when depositing guidelines are based on policy or legislative requirements metadata quality may be an additional burden for data depositors with lower concern for long-term archival strategies. What is needed is a way to demonstrate short-term benefits for depositors that improve metadata quality while reducing the perceived burden of metadata production.nbsp;To improve the quality of data and metadata records for data.gov.au, we explored methods to improve production of rich geospatial visualisations to show users the immediate benefit of structural metadata, while also showing how metadata improved the quality of deposited data records. Additionally, we offered minimal machine-readable metadata profiles that could be created in common office-suite tools to maximise utility while minimising authoring time.This talk covers the challenges of producing structural metadata from records available in the data.gov.au CKAN data repository, methods for importing this into an open-source Aristotle Metadata Registry and how we connected these to produce metadata-driven interactive maps on NationalMap using Terria.io. Lastly, we look at how this data-visualisation focus engagement strategy has improved the quality of open government data.",

                    "abstract": "Driven in part by the open access movement, recent years have seen the expansion of initiatives that aim to promote data sharing, with increasing awareness among stakeholders of the importance of making data publicly available. Consequently, many funders have implemented formal data management plans as part of the proposal process, while data repositories and libraries have developed services, guidelines and trainings to help researchers fulfill funders\u2019 requirements and apply good data management practices so that data can be shared. However, these same parties sometimes neglect the fact that many researchers do not take data management seriously, and perceive it and treat it at best as a form of administrative burden, and at worst as an obstacle to doing research. We will call for the repositioning of data management to the heart of the research process, irrespective of data sharing. Researchers should first and foremost see the value of good data management for their own research, as a way to achieve research excellence. We will share some reflections as to how this could be achieved by reconsidering the roles of funding agencies, data repositories, and librarians in encouraging and supporting good data management practices, beyond the goal of data sharing.",

Curation activities are distributed across institutional and national repositories, archives, registries and websites. In workflows which prioritise existing research practice and disciplinary standards, researchers provide structured metadata to the Australian Data Archive (ADA) using a template based on the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). These metadata are mapped to RDF and RIF-CS standards and sent to the institutional repository at UNSW Australia, for publication and further dissemination. The primary role of the institutional repository is to move the data around \u2013 to apply standards and protocols that enable the data to be widely and openly accessible.The implementation supports researchers in comprehensively describing their research methods and data according to a widely-adopted disciplinary standard, and reduces their workload relating to institutional reporting and dissemination. The integrity of the institutional data repository is increased by its direct integration with the rich descriptions of data in the disciplinary archive. Added value for the institution is derived from the reporting capabilities of the repository, which links to enterprise systems to generate statistics about the University\u2019s research assets.",

As a major international research library, University of Alberta Libraries (UAL) offers expertise, resources, and services for supporting sound RDM throughout the research lifecycle. In alignment with the Tri-Council statement, UAL has adopted a holistic approach to education and delivering of RDM knowledge and resources across campus, focusing upon a variety of stakeholders. Examples of this include a running series of applied RDM training sessions for liaison librarians, customized information sessions both for Research Services Office and Research Ethics Office staff, and collaborative RDM events and training sessions delivered to researchers and students across campus. Some specific services and platforms offered by UAL include the Portage Data Management Planning (DMP) Assistant, Dataverse, and an open access Education and Research Archive for promoting research discovery, archival, and preservation. This session will provide a brief overview of UAL\u2019s RDM services, methods employed for their delivery and uptake, and both current and emerging RDM initiatives.",

This session will discuss the survey results from participating universities, providing insight into the Canadian RDM landscape while highlighting disciplinary differences and notable results. Survey sections include working with research data, data sharing, funding mandates and research data management services. Information generated by this survey will help inform Canadian institutional services, infrastructure and policies. Participating universities at the time of writing include: Dalhousie University, McGill University, Queen\u2019s University, Ryerson University, University of Alberta, University of British Columbia, University of Ottawa, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and the University of Windsor. The session will also discuss the collaboration process, which resulted in the development of a clearinghouse of generic survey documents (questionnaires, ethics review documents) that will be housed by Portage, Canada\u2019s emerging national RDM infrastructure project. These documents can be used by other institutions to conduct similar studies.

Preliminary reviews of the literature identified almost fifty individual institutional results, mostly surveys from Highest or Higher Research Activity institutions. Henderson and Knott (2015) explicitly argue that no further surveys are needed because of the breadth and depth already covered by these studies. However, no overarching analysis has yet been conducted to examine cross-institutional trends and identify best practices or gaps in the literature.nbsp;To address these issues, the authors will compare published faculty RDM needs assessments. Studies to be included will be US-based, in order to retain homogeneity regarding research institution classification and funding mandates. Studies must be specifically about RDM needs and/or services, as opposed to broader library services, and should not be only evaluations of implemented library RDM services.nbsp;Research questions for this project include: identifying question overlaps; identifying which research data issues are common across institutions; determining if graduate students and research staff were considered in the needs assessments; and what gaps in the literature yet remain.nbsp;Henderson ME, Knott TL.

                    "abstract": "In recent years there have been debates on \u201cWould big data replace  marketing and social surveys\u201d among marketing and social research  communities in international level. The most trending idea is that big  data will not replace MR, but that it will give support to the research.  The main explanation of this idea is that big data could not reveal  customers\u2019 insights. However they agree that big data could help to  conduct MR in an effective way. There is lots of evidence. Therefore MR societies are considering cooperating with big data owners,  hiring the new skills of data analysts, combining quantitative and  qualitative data for making value together with big data owners, and  investing in big data platforms, etc. In this paper, I will outline  possible links between big data and MR and usage of big data in MR.  I  will also discuss some cases known in the global level, showing how big  data and MR are combined. For Mongolia, which shifted to a market economy after the socialistic  regime was destroyed, big data is quite new concept, even though the  value of market research has been recognized by businesses a few years  ago. In the international MR communities, big data usage is trending  topic. We have to follow the trend, and hope that it will be realized  soon by our communities. There are some cases of using big data in  marketing and social research, especially in the research design.  Because big data is quite a new concept for us, we have opportunities  and challenges to use big data. So I will include practices of using big  data in our work and opportunities and challenges to use it in this  paper. Then I will suggest solution to use opportunities in an effective  way and solve challenges in our case.",

                    "abstract": "Increasingly, large bibliographic databases are hosted by dedicated teams that commit to database quality, curation, and sharing, thereby providing excellent sources of data. Some databases, such as PubMed or HathiTrust Digital Library, offer APIs and describe the steps to retrieve or process their data. Others of comparable size and importance to bibliographic scholarship, such as the ACM digital library, still forbid data mining. The additional cleaning and expansion steps required to overcome barriers to data acquisition must be reproducible and incorporated into the curation pipeline, or the use of large bibliographic databases for analysis will remain costly, time-consuming, and inconsistent.nbsp;In this presentation, we will describe our efforts to create reproducible workflows to generate datasets from three large bibliographic databases: PubMed, DBLP (as a proxy for the ACM digital library), and HathiTrust. We will compare these sources of bibliographic data and address the following: initial download and setup, gap analysis, supplemental sources for data retrieval and integration. By sharing our workflows and discussing both automated and manual steps of data enhancements, we hope to encourage researchers and data providers to think about sharing the responsibility of openness, transparency and reproducibility in re-using large bibliographic databases.",

                    "abstract": "Social media are used by more and more people. It influences how people communicate, how they gather information and how they behave \u2013 not only on social media platforms but in general.For example, WeChat is used by 700 million people in China. Additional services such as payment systems, language training etc. are incorporated into this app, resulting in a huge source of personal information. It is likely that such repositories will be one future of data collections.Research in the social sciences must be enabled to analyse social media data to understand how societies in general are changing and developing. This personal data should not only be used by commercial companies. The social sciences therefore need to build methods and infrastructures to access social media data sources and to support analyses. For several reasons (e.g. privacy concerns, proprietary data) existing secure data solutions seem to be particularly interesting to facilitate social media data access and sharing. Secure access solutions would also ensure proper documentation and quality of the data and the reproducibility of results. The talk will present first approaches to adapt and develop the Secure Data Center at GESIS also as a platform for social media data analysis.",
