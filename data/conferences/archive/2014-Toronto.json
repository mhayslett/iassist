                    "abstract": "The management, publication, and preservation of datasets have become issues of increasing importance for universities, research institutions, and government agencies. While the reasons and mandates for these activities, and the kinds of datasets collected, differ among these types of institutions, other aspects of data management throughout the research lifecycle concern all of them, including (but not limited to): the discoverability of their data; the choice of metadata standard(s) and the creation of metadata; providing visualization and interaction with data; selection and migration of data formats for long-term preservation; policy development; and storage requirements. Yet, these types of institutions tend to follow different paths in data management and curation, choose different infrastructures, metadata standards and platforms. Are these different approaches inevitably rooted in the differences between these types of organizations and their missions and culture? Or are there lessons they could learn from each other to improve their own practice? The purpose of this symposium is to explore that question. We will have presentations first, then form breakout groups along the lines of different aspects such as platform choice, policy developments, metadata creation. At the end, all will come back together to share the results of their discussion.",

Drawing on classic works by Cleveland (Visualizing Data), Tufte (The Visual Display of Quantitative Information), and Wilkinson (The Grammar of Graphics), a range of best practices for visualization will be illustrated. Recently developed techniques for large-scale, 3D, and interactive visualization will also be discussed. This discussion will be based on works such as Graphics of Large Datasets: Visualizing a Million (Unwin, Theus, and Hofmann), the Handbook of Data Visualization (Chen, Hardle, and Unwin), and Trends in Interactive Visualization: A State of the Art Survey (Liere, Adriaansen and Zudilova-Seinstra) For each of these approaches, methods for creating similar graphics in the R open-source statistical language will be demonstrated, using packages such as ggplot2, lattice, and rggobi. Interactive visualization packages such as shiny and healthvis will also be explored. Prior familiarity with R is helpful but not required. ",

Major data archives such as IPUMS and ICPSR now make many such datasets available for online analysis in SDA. Although users can easily generate simple tables using SDA, more complex analyses often require the use of other analytic procedures and the recoding of variables into more usable categories.The purpose of this workshop is to provide data librarians with a greater facility in using the SDA programs for recoding variables and the generation of new variables, in order to be able to produce the customized summaries that are often requested. The generation of subsets of data for input into other analysis systems (like Stata, SAS, and SPSS) will also be covered. Workshop participants will practice using those procedures by making use of the U.S. Census data and some international datasets available in the IPUMS archive.Some basic familiarity with SDA will be presumed. However, no special expertise in SDA is required.",

Building on the MPC\u2019s past experience with demographic data infrastructure projects such as IPUMS and NHGIS, Terra Populus seeks to lower the barriers for conducting interdisciplinary human-environment research by making data from different domains easily interoperable. It incorporates a variety of data types, including census microdata, census summary data, and raster data describing land cover, land use, and climate. The data access system allows users to create customized data extracts blending variables from all data types and providing the output in the user\u2019s preferred format. In this workshop, attendees will learn about the content and data processing capabilities of Terra Populus and learn how to obtain and use the data. Attendees will create extracts, download data over the internet, and analyze it in a statistical, spreadsheet, or GIS software package. (Please note: participants must bring their own laptops.)",

The project consists of two  phases; the first phase focusses on the restoration and preservation of  the 1961, 1966, 1971 and 1981 census of Great Britain; the second phase  will create public use and researcher samples for each census. This  paper will outline the key issues on the restoration of the original  data, first read from backup tapes earlier in the millennium and discuss  the key issues surrounding the necessity for documentation in the  successful recovery of historic data. It will also discuss the key  lessons learned in both restoring files, and preserving and documenting  current datasets for future use. The second part of the paper will  explain what public use and researcher samples have been made available,  and the principles behind their construction.",

The original dataset was created in 1999 with an  extraction program built in Fortran.  In 2013, this valuable data is  barely machine-readable and in dire need of rescue.  This paper will  describe the steps that were taken to rescue, migrate and preserve the  unique observational data within ClimoBase for future use in climate  science, and the many lessons that were learned in the process.   It  will address best practices for a data rescue workflow and the  importance of preserving research datasets and their metadata.",

A Purdue University political  scientist in her role as a member of the AI-USA\u2019s Archives Advisory  Committee, discovered the need to preserve the early records of AI-USA,  and in her professional capacity was also aware of the research value of  the documents. In particular, she was interested in patterns of change  in the culture of human rights appeals and legal instrumentation.  Through contractual agreement, the researcher was able to obtain the  documents. She was also able to obtain two data sources, both containing  data about the Urgent Action Bulletins dating back to 1974. In addition  to these data sources, through Nvivo coding, a third data source was  created. This paper will discuss the collaborative relationship with  AI-USA, the merging of the data sources, additional metadata  development, and the final dataset created for the Purdue Researcher.  Additionally, three research products resulting from the project will be  discussed: a faceted research dataset, a raw dataset inclusive of the  merged data sources and metadata, and a human rights controlled  vocabulary honed from several existing vocabularies developed for this  project.",

The GHDx includes  entries (records) for surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and many  other sources of health-related data and provides context for those  datasets through pages on countries, series and systems, and  organizations. For the 40th iASSIST Conference, IHME will provide a  Track 1 Individual Proposal covering the development and implementation  of the GHDx, showing how the GHDx enables the successful collection,  storage, and attribution of social science data and demonstrating  visualizations linking input data to research products. This session  will cover the challenges of data sensitivity, management, and the  \u201cvalue chain\u201d of data in research. Presenters will further explore how  skilled cataloging, technology and data management improve data  linkages, standardize attribution, integrate sources, and ensure data  discovery for IHME\u2019s researchers, thereby improving IHME\u2019s publicly  available estimates and reports.",

Currently, however, the  landscape of data repositories and metadata services is uneven and  incoherent even within disciplinary boundaries. In our project  da|raSearchNet we address this problem for the case of the social  sciences by designing and implementing an integrated search  infrastructure that aims at fostering data sharing within the  discipline. We build on the outcomes of the completed project \u201cda|ra \u2013  development of a registration agency for social science data\u201d that  already integrates metadata from nearly 20.000 data files and other  resources from more than 30 data providers in one database and search  application. We are planning to extend this service by automizing our  existent metadata recording workflows and by incorporating even more  metadata from large comparative survey programmes, from data archives  around the world, from qualitative data providers, and other relevant  players. Our goal is to establish da|raSearchNet as a comprehensive,  easy-to-use metadata store for secondary researchers. In our  presentation we describe in detail how we will approach this task in  terms of international networking and cooperation, metadata  standardization, and search engine technology.",

By using the  DDI-Lifecycle standard you can make meta-analyses and comparative  analyses on data materials from different research areas. In the Danish  Data Archive we archive and disseminate health data as well as data from  the social sciences. By linking those kinds of data we can get new  forms of knowledge on the social impact on public health. Danish Data  Archive facilitate the use of registries and databases from the health  care system and other administrative resources, along with health  surveys and the possibility to link it to classic social surveys like  surveys of cultural habits. The different kind of data material makes  the comparison complicated. Data has been collected by different  researchers and institutions for different purposes. The DDI-Lifecycle  standardized metadata and comprehensive study descriptions are the key  to make linking and comparison possible.",

It  supports documentation of longitudinal studies as well as the creation  of custom datasets. OAI-PMH support for harvesting of studies can be  easily set up. The metadata of studies can be exported as DDI 3.1 XML  (since version 4.2). Since CakePHP is an MVC framework and supports  theming, Questasy can be easily modified to meet specific customer  needs. Version 5.0 saw two main features implemented: multilingual  support and DDI 3.1 import. For future developments we will investigate  whether we can implement DDI 3.2 export and import. Further issues that  will be implemented are better documentation of questionnaire routing,  summary statistics of variables and dissemination of datasets and syntax  created by researchers.",

Available  metadata tools do not consider the variety of research data of the  research data centre and the workflow of the data documentation within  departments and the collaboration between departments. Therefore we have  started an international development project in cooperation with TBA 21  Assessment Systeme GmbH (Germany), OPIT Consulting Kft. (Hungary) and  Colectica (USA) in 2012 to handle and standardized the metadata for all  kinds of data in one technical application. Beside the metadata portal  there will be a web application for the data users. The focuses of the  presentation is the appropriate subset of the DDI standard first and  second the application of the metadata portal for users as well as the  workflow within departments e.g. user administration and less the  technical structure behind the metadata portal.",

Our system also enable paragraph-level citation.  The crux of  this exciting project has been the incorporation of object and  sub-object level metadata using the QuDEx metadata schema in addition to  DDI study-level metadata, and using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)  for encoding textual data.    The QuDex schema was initially released in  2006 following a project undertaken by the UK Data Archive and Metadata  Technologies.  QuDEx enables simple description of collections, data  objects, parts of data objects, captures formal relationships between  them, and analytical elements such as categories, codes and memos.  The  Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) has further provided a powerful tool for  marking up bodies of text to enable rich web display. We will discuss  how we have implemented the DDI, QuDEx and the TEI in the UK Quali Bank  browsing system, and describe our use of technologies: an XML database  (Base X) to store and deliver both metadata and textual data, and Solr  and XQuery for powerful searching.",

The GLES Study is a large and ambitious election study in Germany. It  is structured in eleven components conducted in different modes which  are connected by a common core questionnaire. The GLES Question Database  enables users to search for questions and is currently used as an  internal tool for the GLES project. A public release is planned until  summer 2014. Questions are shown with their answer categories, their  variables, and their association to studies, along with some basic study  level information. Studies may also be compared to see differences in  methodology and topics covered. The GLES Question Database is a first  product based on the STARDAT development that was shown at IASSIST  before. It is based on DDI-Lifecycle re-usable components that build a  basic common infrastructure for several applications. The GLES  documentation was imported from a project specific database into  DDI-Lifecycle format and combined with study level information from the  GESIS Data Archive. The presentation will show challenges and solutions  of the development of the GLES Question Database and the possibilities  to use it for similar data collection projects.",

A tool that allows researchers to create documented and  citable data extracts that are directly related to their queries would  allow more time to be spent on public health research questions instead  of data management.  MIDUS (Midlife in the United States) is a national  longitudinal study of approximately 10,000 Americans designed to study  aging as an integrated biopsychosocial process. The study has a unique  blend of social, health, and biomarker data collected over several  decades.  In late 2013, the the United States National Institutes of  Health funded MIDUS to create a DDI-based, harmonized data extraction  system. This tool will facilitate identification and harmonization of  similar MIDUS variables, while enhancing the MIDUS online repository  with a data extract function. This will accomplish something  unprecedented: the ability to obtain customized cross-project downloads  of harmonized MIDUS data that are DDI-compliant. Doing so will greatly  enhance efficient and effective public use of the large longitudinal and  multi-disciplinary datasets that comprise the MIDUS study.  This  session will discuss project background and demonstrate the current  state of the software.",

This derivation  process, or provenance, can be hard to understand for a researcher  attempting to use or explore a given dataset. Without understanding the  provenance of a dataset, it can be impossible establish whether it is  appropriate to use for a given investigation, because its history  remains a black box with no way to see inside. The infrastructure upon  which the semantic web is built provides a means to label the  relationships of social science datasets with logical meaning according  to standardized ontologies and controlled vocabularies. This paper  outlines the work of the Comprehensive Data Documentation and Access  Repository (CED2AR) to integrate provenance metadata encoded according  to the W3C PROV ontology with a DDI-based repository with the aim of  making US Census data more discoverable and accessible.",

This paper will summarise the challenges that the  editorial team face in pulling together what will be an unprecedentedly  large collection of teaching datasets and will canvas audience feedback  on what might be seen as must-have or best practice from a librarian and  library-user perspective. This aims to be an open-minded session and an  opportunity for delegates to work closely with a publisher on thinking  through some difficult yet important issues at the very start of a new  project.",

SOAN has clear pedagogical goals for this project.  One, allow students doing local research to build upon the work of  previous students who have done similar projects and to avoid  duplication of effort. Two, make greater use of student data. Often the  student who does the data collection spends most of their time on that  and has little time left over for data analysis. Three, give students a  fuller data collection, analysis, and management experience. I will  report upon my experiences as the data librarian on this project and the  lessons that have been learned. At the moment, we are using a Dataverse  on the Harvard Dataverse Network. This has been easy to create, but it  means that we have to conform to certain standards built into this  network. There are also challenges associated with the focus on  qualitative data which can include interview transcripts, scanned  magazine ads, and text from newspapers and other documentary sources.",

What roles can  librarians and other information professionals play in teaching these  competencies to graduate students? This paper will report on preliminary  findings from an investigation into the data management competencies  and skill gaps of graduate students in the social sciences. Building  from the work of the Data Information Literacy (DIL) project  (http://datainfolit.org), this study uses an interview-based approach to  discern how competencies in working with data are understood and valued  by graduate students and their faculty advisors. The DIL project  identified and employed 12 data competencies as starting points for  interviews and for developing educational programming on data literacies  for graduate students. As the original DIL project focused on students  in five different STEM fields, this extended study into the social  sciences (DIL-SS) will allow for comparisons of perceptions and  practices between these disciplines. In addition, DIL-SS presents an  opportunity to further develop the 12 DIL competencies and test their  relevance to educational needs in the social sciences. Our findings will  inform the work of librarians and others involved in offering data  management education and consulting services in academic settings.",

We discuss the pedagogical benefits that using  qualitative data in the classroom can provide. First, combining  exemplary articles and books with the data that underlie those studies  allows for a more effective description of the methods being taught and  better demonstration of how they work. Second, with access to data,  students can more effectively practice using the methods about which  they are learning through applying them in context to real social  science problems; they are also introduced to the notion and practice of  replication earlier in their academic trajectory. Third, through  exposure to \u201creal\u201d qualitative data, students learn about the process of  generating data in the context of the use of particular analytic  methods, as well as about how to clearly document that generation.",

This session will describe a  workshop for developing core skills in data literacy. In light of the  significant gap between common practice and effective strategies  emerging from specific research communities, we incorporated elements of  a lab format to build proficiency with specific strategies. The lab  format is traditionally used for training procedural skills in a  controlled setting, which is also appropriate for teaching many daily  data management practices. The focus of the curriculum is to teach data  management strategies that support data quality, transparency, and  re-use. Given the variety of data formats and types used in health and  social sciences research, we adopted a skills-based approach that  transcends particular domains or methodologies. Attendees applied  selected strategies using a combination of their own research projects  and a carefully defined case study to build proficiency.",

A central service hub within Eu-RAN should host different  services that support researchers and research projects. One of the  attached services is a Microdata Computation Centre (MiCoCe). It is made  to enable analysis of distributed data sources. Due to data security  reasons, some of the most interesting data must stay physically in the  facilities of the data owner. At the same time, there is an increasing  demand on analysing data from different European sources simultaneously.  The challenge is therefore twofold: enable analysis with distributed  data sources while fulfilling the requirement of not moving the data.  This talk will present the outcomes of a workshop held in Nuremberg,  Germany, that focused on this topic. Data managers, IT-experts and  statisticians discussed approaches that could support scientific  research with decentralized data sources. Solutions come from the areas  of grid computing, federated databases, statistical modelling and so  forth. Having a service like the MiCoCe would enable the use of already  available data sources in Europe and in addition make access to Big Data  sources possible.",

Yet access to these micro-data for research  purposes, particularly across national borders, is often restricted for  confidentiality or legal reasons. Despite the benefits that accrue to  society from allowing comparative research to be undertaken using  cross-national data sources (such as policy evaluation), researchers  face significant barriers in making comparative analyses of data  collected in more than one Member State. Legal restrictions on the  dissemination and transfer of data, and the consequential cost of  visiting the data within its country of origin, prohibit access.  \u2013  Through the \u201cData without Boundaries\u201d(DwB) initiative, the European  Remote Access Network (Eu-RAN) is a vision of cross-border data access.  The realisation of this European data infrastructure dream will evolve  step-by-step.  Making the first jump requires a connection between two  Research Data Centres. The Research Data Centre (FDZ) at IAB and the  Secure Lab at the UK Data Archive have joined forces to provide  connections to each other\u2019s centres. A researcher in the UK can access  sensitive German micro-data held at IAB and vice versa. In this talk, we  present the results of our joint-initiative.",

                    "abstract": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is building a taxonomy and lexicon of  terms and concepts of its technical language.  The terms will also be  linked to plain English words the public tends to use in place of them.   The taxonomy will first be organized as a thesaurus, with possible  expansion as resources permit and the need demands.  The lexicon will be  an alphabetical listing of the terms.  The main drivers for the project  are to support 1) the development of an agency wide series  dissemination system, and 2) tagging documents, reports, and  periodicals.  An aim is to ensure consistent retrieval of documents and  data.  A team was assembled over the summer to address these issues.   First, we gathered the terms and underlying concepts describing time  series.  These will be organized, and concurrently, the plain English  words the public uses will be identified.  Finally, terms, concepts, and  plain English describing other data will be added.  The initial phase  of this project is due in January, but additional work and improvements  will be necessary.  Organizations that build thesauri find the system  must be continually maintained, so this will be an on-going effort.",

                    "abstract": "Without controlled index terms, data retrieval within a data catalogue  becomes at best hit and miss.  The UK Data Archive manages two thesauri:  the multilingual ELSST thesaurus, and the monolingual HASSET thesaurus,  from which it is derived.  Over the last year, through funding from the  UK\u2019s ESRC, the Archive has developed both of these thesauri, plus their  management applications, and created linkages between them.  Extending  ISO 25964, the UKDA has developed a way of mapping its social science  thesauri to facilitate cross-national data retrieval.  It has also  created SKOS formats and is developing a new and innovative application  for thesaurus management which combines term visualisation with tree  structures.  The two thesauri now share a clearly defined, common set of  core concepts, but have room for divergence.  The new application will  allow terms to be promoted to the core set, where they exhibit partial  or exact equivalence, or be demoted to \u2018non-core\u2019.  The application  allows authorised language equivalents to be added to ELSST terms.   Bundled suggestions will also be made for changes to the thesaurus terms  or structure, linked to the tree structure.  This paper describes the  new application and the processes used within the UKDA for thesaurus  management.",

                    "abstract": "Current practice in subject indexing of study descriptions in data  catalogues often consists in assigning a limited number of non-linked  subject terms. To control for semantic ambiguity and improve recall in  retrieval, ideally a thesaurus is used to perform this task. However,  this practice does not solve the problem of syntactic ambiguity in  subject indexing, which is of particular relevance to  questionnaire-based study descriptions. For example, the general terms  attitude, behaviour, and experience may co-occur with subject terms like  democracy, homosexuality, and religion without being apparent, to which  of these subjects the attitudes, behaviours, and experiences have been  enquired. This kind of syntactic ambiguity results in imprecise  retrieval, in particular when in-depth indexing is employed.  We suggest  a concept of thesaurus-based syntactic indexing for study descriptions  that aims at using high specificity and pre-coordination of terms with  the intention of improving recall as well as precision in retrieval. We  are working with role indicators (indicating general or subject terms)  and with term linking in order to index concepts on the item or variable  level (e.g. \u2018democracy: attitude\u2019; \u2018homosexuality: behavior\u2019;  \u2018religion: experience\u2019). We plan to employ our concept of  thesaurus-based syntactic indexing to enable sophisticated retrieval  techniques like faceted searching.",

GESIS has  developed the software program CharmStats (Coding and Harmonizing of  Statistics) to provide social researchers with a structured,  documentable and publishable solution to data harmonization. By enabling  researchers to simultaneously perform and document the process of  variable coding and harmonization, the resulting CharmStats Projects can  be used for publication and citation providing also syntaxes for  proprietary software packages. The presentation reviews the CharmStats  software and the logic behind it. We will demonstrate how the  application allows users to browse stored harmonization projects. Using  the concept \u2018Education\u2019 and data from the CSES (Comparative Study of  Electoral Systems) as our basis, we will present step by step a full  publishable CharmStats Project.",

However,  despite community agreement that implementation of effective RDM  techniques rather than just training is the critical factor in producing  good quality reusable data, there has been less research on the  effectiveness and impact of training and support. This paper contributes  to this literature by asking participants in Research Data Management  training workshops organized by the GESIS \u2013 Leibniz Institute for the  Social Sciences how and if implemented knowledge gained from our  workshops. GESIS launched its Archive and Data Management Training  Center in 2011. The center provides introductory level training for a  pan-European audience of researchers in RDM. Since its establishment,  the center has held four workshops attended by 60 people from 12  European nations. As part of our workshops we gather profiles of  participants \u2014 their research type, discipline, why they attend, and  initial workshop evaluations, thereby building up a profile of our  audience that allows us to gain impressions of the effectiveness of  training that could have wider lessons for the RDM community.",

                    "abstract": "Successful data management involves actions throughout the entire  research lifecycle, but often providers of data management services  directly interact with researchers only at isolated points in their  study. This is a challenge for service providers when trying to help  researchers integrate best practices into their workflow, as much of  this work takes place in their own offices, labs, or with the help of  other specialized support services on campus. Therefore, an important  part of promoting data management on campus is to make specialized  institutional support offices aware of the impact their services can  have on the management of research data.  This paper will describe  efforts at a large, decentralized, mid-western American university to  promote data management practices and awareness by reaching out to  offices across campus, including those involved in grants consulting,  human subjects protection, data security, survey services, statistical  consulting, and technology commercialization. From the perspective of a  unit specializing in direct research support, we will also discuss  specific ways in which our office is integrating data management into  our services. We suggest similar offices at other universities may be  overlooked but important allies of libraries in promoting data  management practices.",

But challenges still exist of how to best address research  data management on a multidisciplinary scale and across the research  lifecycle.  In this talk, we present our experiences in designing,  governing, and maintaining institutional services for Research Data  Management at Bielefeld University. They are a result of a bottom-up  development strategy in cooperation with scientists, library, computing  center, and research administration department. We focus on the support  for data management planning, providing a web-based data management plan  tool.   Using a template-based system, the capabilities of the tool are  flexible, allowing researchers to cover the specific needs of a  project, coming from funding requirements, subject-matter, or the nature  of the projects\u2019 data.   For data publication, the institutional  repository has been extended. Data can be published under an Open  Database license and is registered with DataCite. For several  disciplines, special services exist. For instance, the repository  interoperates with research platforms. Federated author profiles make  research data easily accessible from project webpages and staff  directory.   With this approach, first requirements from Bielefeld  University\u2019s researchers and funders are met.",

Challenges for librarians and other data service providers include  understanding the differences in disciplinary practices and identifying  researchers receptive to engaging with RDM services.  Prominent journals  requiring that supplementary data be made publicly available could be  one possible driver of increased interest in the development of  institutional support for RDM practices in the sciences.  Using this  driver as an instrument to identify potential \u201cclients\u201d, we propose a  replicable methodology for local assessment by examining high impact  journal policies and harvesting institutional publishing data to  determine current local RDM practice across disciplines.  The results of  the data gathered in this analysis can supplement traditional  researcher interviews and identify clusters to engage in further RDM  discussion or projects, as well as allow targeted services, training  and/or advocacy efforts.",

Data management and curation (DMC) is comprised of (1) data management  planning, (2) data curation, (3) digital curation, and (4) digital  preservation concepts. The survey included a 25-question adapted Data  Asset Framework (DAF) questionnaire. The survey was administered to five  high-profile research labs at Florida State University and scientists  affiliated with the National Science Foundation (NSF) EarthCube project  in Fall 2013. The survey yielded 107 completes, an 83% completion rate,  and 10 scientists that agreed to participate in Phase 2 of my  dissertation research that includes interviews currently in progress.  The purpose of this survey is to build a better understanding of  research data held in departments across multiple disciplinary domains,  to inform strategic planning for data management at research labs at  Florida State University, and to inform the wider research data  management community. This presentation will present survey results from  an adapted DAF survey as part of a mixed-methods research approach  investigating the data management and curation practices of scientists  in research labs and the NSF EarthCube project.",

The datasets include  Design and Art Australia Online, the Australian Dictionary of Biography,  AustLit, AusStage, the Dictionary of Sydney, the PARADISEC linguistics  archive, and the AUSTLang database. Incoming records are mapped to a  common data model, but not merged, while their provenance and  distinctive content are retained.   HuNI also provides tools for working  with the aggregated data.

Such data sets  represent a diversity of formats, may have documentation and curation  weaknesses, and are often not easily found. In addition, there are  significant variations in approaches in collecting and managing those  data. A 2011 survey by Science found that, \u201ceven within a single  institution there are no standards for storing data, so each lab, or  often each fellow, uses ad hoc approaches.\u201d The European Commission  says, \u201cDifferent institutions archive their research data in different  ways \u2013 making access difficult from outside the institution.\u201d   This  paper will present the results of an international survey of research  data repositories that collect and manage heterogeneous data sets. The  survey will be conducted in January/February 2013 under the auspices of  the RDA Long Tail of Research Data Interest Group. The results will  provide the broader community with a deeper understanding of the  metadata and vocabularies that are currently in use within these  contexts, with the aim of developing community-based recommendations to  ensure lightweight interoperability and visibility of this type of  research data across the globe.",

It is a four-year exchequer funded project, comprising six  Irish academic partners, and is supported by the National Library of  Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland (NAI) and the Irish national  broadcaster RT\u00c3137;. A key task is to link together and preserve  the rich data held by Irish institutions, provide a central internet  access point and interactive multimedia tools. Enabling access and reuse  to research data is a central challenge. This paper outlines how the  key challenges and lessons learned in the process of building this  national repository. It argues that a process of qualitative interviews  conducted by DRI allowed us to develop a complex understanding of the  barriers which might limit the ability of data to be shared. An  unexpected outcome of this process was it facilitated community  engagement. This assisted in developing the relations of trust which are  so key to overcoming barriers to access and data sharing.",

Many useful data sources\u2013such as  campaign finance and lobbying records, speeches, court rulings,  legislative bills, news, geocoded event data, etc.\u2013are of interest to  social scientists and the librarians who assist them. These sources come  in a variety of formats and often require considerable work to extract,  organize, and clean up for analysis. As more of my clientele have  expressed interest in using these kinds of sources, I decided to embark  on a personal training effort to learn how to scrape and process text  from the web using the Python programming language. This paper will  present reflections on my experience, the utility of this kind of  training for liaison librarians, and issues surrounding professional  development and the acquisition of new skills by librarians.",

                    "abstract": "For many students, the Library\u2019s contribution to the research process  begins and ends with the literature review.  In these cases, librarians  might assist students with pre-defined research questions or broad  research topics to locate existing literature, primary sources, and  data.  However, as studies have shown, students often struggle with the  first step of research: developing a viable question.  This presents a  unique opportunity for librarians and, especially, data librarians to  provide guidance while at the same time supporting campus-wide  initiatives to improve critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and  information literacy skills.  Specifically, a small, data-based  assignment for undergraduates could be employed to help students  identify a research question.  This paper will present the results of a  series of pilot projects in which undergraduate international relations  students were tasked with developing research proposals based on  exploratory analyses of statistical databases from international and  non-governmental organizations.  The paper will discuss the development,  outcomes, and assessment of data assignments piloted over the past two  years and including traditional lectures, hands-on data labs, and online  modules.",

While we often focus on  research lifecycles, incentives, storage and transmission technologies,  metadata and data sharing we tend to overlook the epistemological  incongruencies of diverse research and data practices. All data creation  processes, even if unknowingly, make assumptions about the world and  what exists as a unique unit that can be analyzed. In attempting to make  data meaningful to different audiences, especially across disciplines,  we must pay attention to these epistemological assumptions. Failure to  do so will inevitably frustrate our attempts to develop meaningful  infrastructure for research data and even potentially undermine  effective research through misunderstandings of data. Looking at spatial  data as an example, this presentation will explore the issues of  resolution and unit of analysis as an example of such disciplinary  epistemological assumptions. Based on experiences working with spatial  data across disciplines, this presentation will explore some of the  misunderstandings that arise and suggest ways in which they are  indicative of larger issues surrounding data collections, management and  interpretation.",

Engaging in the work of unified infrastructure requires finding  language that bridges modes of inquiry and meaning, so that all  participants see their place in the whole. This work of finding shared  language involves translation at many levels. Data professionals know  that not everyone means the same thing by \u2018data\u2019 and increasingly we  seek language that spans the practices of social science, sciences,  humanities, and performing arts. This paper aims to highlight some of  the ways in which data professionals are already adept at translation.  Drawing on examples from work as a subject librarian and data  professional at an undergraduate institution, I will elaborate on ways  in which translation permeates our daily work, from helping new  researchers learn the language and methods of a field, to supporting  faculty as they expand their teaching and research across disciplines.  Additionally, our role as semi-outsiders within the institution situates  us well to help drive conversations spanning disciplinary modes of  thinking, in which faculty may also find themselves as semi-outsiders.",

Dissemination  of data from which individual identity can be deduced from the data, by  themselves or with published information is prohibited under the  Statistics and Registration Service Act (SRSA) in the UK, and by similar  legislation elsewhere. Disclosure can arise from matching data on  common keys, spontaneous recognition of oneself, acquaintances or of  those in the spotlight. Disclosure also arises by recognizing  identifiable combinations of characteristics known to the intruder.   Contributing factors to the reduced disclosure risk are: (i) mortality  of data subjects,  using the English Life Tables, this paper estimates  mortality rates for data subjects in the UK census data; (ii) lack of  availability of matching data, by law organisation are limited in time  they can keep personal data; (iii) memory loss, forgetting one\u2019s own  past, as well as that of other data subject; (iv) churn, the tendency  for data to become outdated as circumstances of data subjects change.   Arguably, the contributing factors above are independent and their  effect on disclosure risk therefore additive.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the effect of different legal requirements  and attitudes towards data protection, intellectual property, and  ethical review processes and procedures in Germany and the UK to  illustrate the divergence in regulation. We especially focus on formal  and informal ways of data sharing across disciplines and countries,  highlighting paths to ethical and responsible data sharing. Data  archives often provide discipline specialized research data management  support services. An aspect of support is addressing legal data  protection requirements, intellectual property standards, and ethical  research practices. Researchers encounter laws concerning data  protection and intellectual property throughout the data-lifecycle, but  established research practices can clash with new legal frameworks (see  debate over the proposed reform of European Union data protection  rules). Likewise, changing public attitudes to research and notions of  consent can affect conceptions of what constitutes ethical research.  Archives can help researchers navigate an environment which  simultaneously pushes data sharing, and consideration of the  individual\u2019s right to privacy and protection. However, doing so often  requires negotiating the gaps and contradictions of different national  laws, research cultures, and funding environments.",

The FDZ data  originate from three different sources. From the notification process of  the social security system and the internal procedures of the Federal  Employment Agency process-generated data are obtained. Furthermore, the  IAB acquires data by conducting own surveys. The use of weakly anonymous  data is subject to restrictions concerning data protection legislation.  Due to these regulations the data can be analyzed only via on-site use.  For this purpose, the FDZ provides separate workplaces for guest  researchers in Nuremberg and further locations in Germany and in the  USA. As this network of research data centers is built out it is with  the expectation that improved access to restricted data managed with a  high degree of data security will yield benefits to policy makers as  well as to scholars. The benefits and the means for documenting these  benefits is a central focus of the paper.",

The private-cloud service is accessible via  remote access according to the researcher\u2019s data provider agreement.  In  this presentation I will show how and why CRADC\u2019s clientele continues  to grow exponentially; discuss compliancy, regulations and standards  based upon a specific data provider agreement; and review the need for  continuous monitoring.

            "abstract": "<p>Laws and procedures governing access to confidential data differ across national and regional boundaries, resulting in a complicated picture for researchers undertaking comparative research. Such laws continue to change and evolve \u2013 for example, in the U.S. where revisions to the Common Rule are now being discussed, and in Europe where the EU Council is reforming the data protection legal framework. Access to confidential data also differs across disciplines: sensitive data that involves endangered species, at-risk cultural heritage sites, stigmatized and vulnerable populations, and personal health information require particularly rigorous review and protection. In addition, we are seeing a proliferation of non-disclosure agreements, often applied to proprietary data, which make data sharing difficult if not impossible.   This session will elucidate the country- and region-specific policies currently in place and those envisioned for the future, with an emphasis on the role of research ethics boards, the degree of freedom and responsibility placed on data custodians (e.g., researchers, clinicians, institutions, libraries, health authorities, and repositories), and strategies for gaining access to confidential data and promoting its use within the current and expected legal contexts.</p>",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, data sharing and data reuse in scientific research have  been discussed in greater frequency. This has occurred with the  revolution in the field of science known as data-intensive research and  the growth of data in \u201cbig science\u201d. Discussions regarding qualitative  data sharing and reuse have also been very active, especially in Europe,  where data archiving practices are well established. There has been a  significant amount of interest in the issues related to the reuse of  qualitative data. Organizations, such as the Social Research Council in  the UK and the Australian Research Council have been trying to support  this interest. However, the discussions do not seem to be as prominent  in the United States, despite a long history of depositing and curating  practices of scientific data. This study aims to understand the  researchers\u2019 thoughts and perceptions regarding qualitative data reuse  in the field of social science in the United States. In particular, this  study will focus on the barriers or hindrances to reusing qualitative  data, the appropriate conditions for reusing qualitative data, and the  perspectives of qualitative researchers on data reuse. The preliminary  results from the in-depth interviews with qualitative researchers in  social science will be presented.",

Social science researchers have become  more and more interested in combining geographic analysis and  traditional quantitative and statistical methods in order to test  hypotheses and present arguments in more effective ways. Yet,  discovering, accessing, and using international geospatial data and  statistics is still a challenge for researchers: As OECD Global Science  Forum report (2013) noted, information about the existence of micro-data  and their availability for the re-use is often difficult to find. The  language, legal, cultural, and technological obstacles often exacerbate  the difficulty to re-use the discovered data.   In this paper, I review  what kinds of new data on East Asian countries have been recently  developed by national statistical agencies, government departments, and  academic institutions. Also, what obstacles researchers have encountered  in using the data in their research are investigated.",

We define these two  behaviours as follows: a) data sharing: \u201cthe voluntary provision of  information from one individual or institution to another for purposes  of legitimate scientific research\u201d (Boruch, 1985) b) data citation: \u201cthe  practice of providing a reference to data in the same way as  researchers routinely provide a bibliographic reference to outputs such  as journal articles, reports and conference papers\u201d (ANDS, 2011)   Drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (Azjen, 1991), the study  explores researchers\u2019 current and intended data sharing and data  citation practices, attitudes towards each behaviour, and perceived  social and institutional barriers and supports for data sharing and data  citation within their organisation and discipline. The paper will  present the results of the ADA survey, and compare with two recent US  studies to explore cross-national similarities and differences in data  sharing and citation behavior.",

This paper will outline the key results from the first  year of the project including the proofs of concept in the Humanities  and Social Sciences (HSS) and High Energy Physics (HEP) and will outline  the commonalities between the extremely different disciplines that will  inform a way forward for implementing an identifier ecosystem across  disciplines. The paper will highlight technical work that has already  been performed between making the identifier systems interoperable and  will showcase value added services that have been built on the open APIs  provided by the identifier systems. The paper will also outline gaps  that currently hinder the adoption of such systems and outline a way  forward for libraries and data centres to help implement these  initiatives.  The ODIN project ran a session at IASSIST 2013 and are  grateful to have the opportunity to update the community on the progress  made in its first full year.",

The CPES joins together  three nationally representative surveys of adults living in the United  States: the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, the National Survey  of American Life, and the National Latino and Asian American Study.  These data were collected face-to-face using the Blaise software. The  Blaise data were transformed into XML capturing the rich metadata  available in Blaise data models. The combined CPES dataset contains  approximately 20,000 interviews. The initial combined dataset had 9.400  raw variables distributed over 92 sections of the three surveys. The  final dataset contains approximately 5,600 harmonized variables, 400  constructed variables and 14 separate weights. The website contains rich  metadata including an interactive cross-walk of all harmonized  variables with question text in 5 languages, response options, missing  data codes, descriptive statistics (frequencies, etc), universes,  detailed documentation of all constructed variables, and descriptive  statistics of all variables, among a wide variety of other products.  These products will be discussed in light of the upcoming release of DDI  3.2 and version 5 of Blaise.",

The primary structure for the collection will be  organized in alignment with the DDI Lifecycle. A goal will be to involve  the DDI community in producing a shared body of resources for all  organizations and individuals using the DDI specification. Best  practices will be reviewed by a team of editors and reviewers and  published on a dedicated website. The presentation will describe the  overall project and some of the specific best practices which will  appear in the initial collection. These will include guidelines for  archives introducing DDI into their workflow and other institutions  already using DDI Codebook and shifting some of their workflow to DDI  Lifecycle. Another area will be utilizing DDI for data discovery.",

Despite the importance of open communication  for scientific progress, present norms do not provide strong incentives  for individual researchers to share data, materials, or their research  process. As an example, journals can provide such incentives by  acknowledging open practices with badges in publications.  Badges do not  define good practice; badges certify that a particular practice was  followed.  This talk will introduce this strategy and the initial three  open practices badges specified by the committee of open science  community members:  Open Data, Open Materials, and Preregistration.  It  will also include examples of implementation and community reaction.",

We  choose to explore this dataset using the open source network graphing  tool Gephi as well as visualization instruments Sci2 used for  scientometry and made available by the University of Indiana (and  introduced in a now famous MOOC on information visualization). The first  results have shown an interesting picture of the collaboration and  financing flows within the country, as well as the limits of the  analysis of research abstracts with tools made for an Anglo-American  context. Research in Switzerland is described in English, German, French  and sometimes Italian with frequent inclusion of foreign expressions.  Such situations certainly occur in other countries and we intend to  explore ways to solve these issues. Our aim is also to share some of the  lessons learned in this work, among which the use of sql queries to  build the input data, and also the effects on the visual outputs of  choices made while processing the data. In the absence of a proper  documentation, these choices turn scientific visualization into black  boxes that become a new challenge for the curious scientist.",

At present [the  UK has] a serious shortage of social science graduates with the right  quantitative skills to evaluate evidence and analyse data. This is not a  new finding. Significant and shared efforts in the last decade have  resulted in a large, national initiative being funded to tackle this  problem in the UK (Q-Step, Nuffield 2013). This PK will highlight the  void in teaching quantitative social science, and show how we (the  ESSTED team at Manchester) are addressing the challenge of embedding  number into the social science curriculum. A variety of techniques have  been adopted and trialled; using real world survey data in the classroom  alongside making students part of the dataset; flipping lectures;  adopting the mantra of \u2018practice\u2019 for what is a real-world and  employable skill. The PK will present: results based on evidence  collated; conclusions based on our experiences; and ideas about how this  is informing the University of Manchester\u2019s Q-Step centre.",

This research, conducted by an intern, takes the form of a  case study exploring how to embed the UK Data Service within four UK  academic libraries. The institutions were selected based on data usage  and the methodology qualitative \u2013 the data is collected through  semi-structured interviews. Background information gathered about  libraries\u2019 structures and strategies suggests that the effect of expense  justification on the support of data providers by libraries poses  challenges to free-at-the-point-of-use (free) data services. In other  words it could result in less focus on support in the form of training  through tutorials or focus groups. The following question arises: are  \u2018free\u2019 services less supported by libraries than those that require fees  because of the need to justify membership expenditures? This  presentation explores how data services can improve interactions with  academic libraries in the UK. By closely examining the strategy of four  UK universities, it sheds light on the challenges in raising awareness  of a data provider like the UK Data Service through collaborating with  libraries. It aims to discover whether the study\u2019s findings can be  applied to other institutions.",

This archive is a research  data-specific repository that can host a wide variety of quantitative  and qualitative data, and is both format- and discipline-agnostic.  We in JHUDMS have begun archiving research data originating from two  NSF-funded engineering research projects. This archiving process has  begun with data associated with publications, which may be a typical  model for library research data archives. These efforts have been an  opportunity to understand the time and effort required for activities  that can add value to a research data collection (e.g. discussions with  the researcher, development of data flow diagrams, migration of data to  non-proprietary formats). We will discuss these collections and the  steps taken to create them. It is of benefit to both the researchers and JHUDMS to scope and  streamline the archiving process with research data associated with  publications in mind. We will discuss our current understanding of the  most effective curation activities we can efficiently accomplish,  parameters for those activities, and those elements perceived by the  researcher to be most valuable.",

The ultimate goal of this programme  is to gather the metadata of nine birth cohort studies into a joint DDI3  repository for online searching. In order to monitor the progress of  this operation we define metrics which reflect the characteristics of  the DDI3 schema, more particularly, its heavy reliance on references,  whereby, whenever possible, a DDI3 element is defined once and reused by  reference wherever it is required. We measure the volume of the  metadata ingested with a Cell Count of the DDI3 xml elements produced  and the quality of the metadata with the Synaptic Density, the ratio of  the DDI3 references over the Cell Count. The Synaptic Density is  expected to have a dual role over the course of the ingestion. In the  earlier phases, it measures the lack of redundancy and monitors the  cleaning and deduplication processes. In the more mature phases of the  repository, it is expected to rise again as re-use, derivations and  harmonisations gradually interweave and enrich the metadata.",

The Network aims to build a world-leading infrastructure for enabling research access to data which is routinely collected by UK and devolved government departments and agencies. The Network highlights the importance of linked administrative data answering key policy-related research questions, and aims to provide a streamlined and coherent pathway through the disparate and difficult requirements for research access to these kinds of resources - everything from data negotiation to ethical and governance review to data security requirements, secure data anlysis facilities and statistical disclosure control. The poster will highlight the network brand and upcoming website launch and present our continuing development plans.",

The poster highlights emerging  technological trends, identifies gaps in digital stewardship capacity  and provides funders and decision-makers with insight into the work  needed to ensure that today\u2019s valuable digital content remains  accessible and comprehensible in the future, supporting a thriving  economy, a robust democracy, and a rich cultural heritage. Founded in  2010, the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) is a consortium  of more than 160 organizations that are committed to the long-term  preservation of digital information.",

                    "abstract": "In August of 2011, Federal Reserve\u2019s librarians were asked to come  together to manage purchased data acquisitions. The new initiative  required one librarian from each of the 12 Reserve Banks and one from  the Board of Governors to implement a common process for data  procurement. It also formalized the use of a common data catalog. The  overall goal was to avoid unnecessary duplication and leverage  purchasing power as whole. In response to the mandate, the managing  librarians of the Federal Reserve System formed a new, collaborative  data work group made up of their 13 chosen data librarians. Together the  group created and implemented innovative system-wide policies and  workflows, including a unique online catalog. Each individual data  librarian was in turn responsible for initiating new policies and  workflows for the data management process within their own Reserve Bank.  In the Chicago Fed, implementation of the new data acquisition regime  has been successful, with variations on its implementation like a  District Data Management Group and educational initiatives about data  use and procurement protocols. In the first two years, the need for  collaborative tools have given way to workflows in SharePoint. Other  solutions are planned.",

At  the IASSIST in Washington, 2012, first ideas of the Eu-RAN concept were  presented. In 2014 a more detailed description of the Eu-RAN  architecture can be given. Separated running European Remote Access  solutions could be improved by connecting them into a Network. A  centralized Single Point of Access (SPA) will make it easier to reach  several decentralized organized network points and ease the work of  researchers running projects with data from different data owners within  this Network. A central service hub within Eu-RAN will host different  tools that support researchers and research projects. One of the  attached services is a Microdata Computation Centre. Additional services  are: a virtual research environments, user account and contract  management, interfaces to research data access, text editors,  statistical software packages, and tools for cooperation like forums,  wikis or instant messaging. This poster shows the architecture of the  Eu-RAN. This infrastructure will improve access to confidential  microdata by mastering the trade-off between researchers needs and data  security; in addition it will lead to legal and organizational  harmonization.",

Agencies such as the NSF and NIH require data management  plans as part of research proposals and the Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP) is requiring federal agencies to develop plans  to increase public access to results of federally funded scientific  research. To be effectively shared, data must be described and  documented, discoverable online, and accessible, both today and into the  future. Data must be curated. Data curation requires data sharing  entities are sustainable. Sustainability requires funding. In early  2014, ICPSR launched a fee-for-deposit service that provides free access  to data and documentation to the public and is sustained by deposit  fees. openICPSR is a research data-sharing service for the social and  behavioral sciences. openICPSR data are: widely and immediately  accessible at no cost to data users, safely stored by a trusted  repository dedicated to long-term data stewardship, and protected  against confidentiality and privacy concerns. This session will  demonstrate the openICPSR system and discuss how researchers can take  advantage of this new means of archiving data to comply with federal  data sharing and preservation standards.",

Often, single-word column headers are the  only hint given to data users, making it difficult to make sense of the  data. Colectica for Microsoft Excel is a free tool to document your  spreadsheet data using DDI, the open standard for data documentation.  With this Excel addin, users can add extensive information about each  column of data. Variables, Code Lists, and the datasets can be globally  identified and described in a standard format. This documentation is  embedded with the spreadsheet, ensuring the information is available  when data are shared. The addin also adds support for SPSS and Stata  formats to Excel. When opening an SPSS or Stata file in Excel, standard  metadata is automatically created from the variable and value labels.  Colectica for Excel can create print-ready reports based on the data  documentation. The information can also be exported to the DDI standard,  which can be ingested into other standards-based tools. This booth will  include live demonstrations of the latest version of the Colectica for  Excel tool, showing how to document the contents of a spreadsheet,  publish the information, and use the documentation to access data in an  informed way.",

In order to support the efforts of a broader goal to  educate others about the research data services that are available to  them and offer tools to meet their data needs, a smaller group of  librarians within the e-research implementation group began a project to  update the data services website. This update provided information and  education regarding the definition of data, intellectual property, data  sharing, funding requirements, files, formats, preservation and storage  information. This poster illustrates how a website can be used as an  instructional model for data documentation and metadata. The goal of  this poster is to provide insight and information as a point of  reference when librarians, researchers, data managers, curators and  scientists meet individuals with data needs.",

Such techniques are intended to assist software  developers in defining and evaluating security risks for a system and in  deducing necessary requirements for design, implementation and  operation. Using several different modelling techniques a group of  participating GESIS staff from various archiving and IT backgrounds  generated a collection of threat models. We then interviewed  participants about their viewpoints, aggregated the models and discussed  them in a group session. Through this process we defined security  requirements and translated them into implementable technical and  organizational security recommendations. Our approach also enabled us to  evaluate the applied techniques\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. We will  explain some of the security requirements we defined and also show how  our process allowed us to make visible different stakeholders\u2019  viewpoints, was able to support meaningful discussion, and facilitated  decision making. Our process can be useful for other archives looking  for ways to define security requirements in the fields of archiving and  data sharing.",

Aila is FSD\u2019s new web based  customer service portal. It will be our main tool for data  dissemination. Aila allows customers to search, browse and review our  data descriptions on study and variable level, and after registration,  download data directly from the service portal. We will demonstrate the  functionality of the portal and share the experiences gained during the  building phase and the first few months of operation. Metka will be  FSD\u2019s tool for managing metadata. Metadata will be entered to Metka,  which in turn will feed other systems at FSD (e.g., Aila). This will  greatly simplify building services based on our rich metadata as it  allows repurposing metadata from a single authorative source. We will  present Metka\u2019s features and show how it connects to FSD\u2019s services and  other systems. The system will be operational in January 2015. Metka is  open source and can be obtained from github. With Aila and Metka, we  have defined the software platform FSD will utilise in building new  tools for the archive and services for our customers. For example,  Shibboleth will be used consistently for user authentication.",

The Center has academic and service excellence on three  subjects: Research Data Management, Data Discovery, and Digital  Preservation. This thematic structure also allows us to expend to other  societal stakeholders interested in data, such as NGO\u2019s, journalists,  government organizations, and the general public. The challenge of the  training centre is not only to provide adequate services to the  designated user communities but also to act as a connecting link between  all experts and centres of excellence within the CESSDA infrastructure  community. The establishment of collaborations with experts interested  in training will allow the maximum flow of information and the constant  improvement of quality of training. The target is to make the Centre  into a reference point of infrastructure training for experts and users.  Activities include coordination and centralized publicising of events,  common training and online materials, as well as common research and  publicising of activities, so that information reaches all relevant  audiences.",

As the  designated repository of CNSS datasets, the Cornell Institute for Social  and Economic Research (CISER) is responsible for creating, curating,  and subjecting to disclosure avoidance techniques the public use and  integrated versions of this series. In addition, CISER provides the  mechanism for finding, discovering, and disseminating the series  complete with a variable shopping basket that allows users to select and  download only the variables that they need. In late 2013, CISER decided  to update its variable shopping basket architecture to improve user  experience and delivery of the collection. In this paper we describe in  detail our updated infrastructure for the Cornell National Social Survey  search, discovery, and download tool. At the backend we employ an XML  repository housing DDI 3 XML files to deliver metadata contents to users  and a relational database to deliver the data itself. Both the XML  repository and Relational database can be queried using XQuery and SQL,  respectively, through a CNSS API that we developed so it can be accessed  from other computing devices.",

                    "abstract": "The diverse nature of liberal arts research makes identifying needs and  providing support for data management a complex task. Attesting to this  diversity, in our survey of 29 departments at Minnesota, we found  differing practices, attitudes, and awareness about managing data and  research materials. Many respondents identified need for data management  support across the research lifecycle, with the largest needs for data  security, preservation, and sharing. However, there are striking  differences across the social sciences, arts, and humanities in  attitudes and perceptions towards data management and what it entails,  perhaps due to differing requirements and cultures in the fields. These  demonstrate that a one-size-fits-all approach to support data management  is not appropriate for a broadly diverse liberal arts college; rather,  the services we develop should be sensitive to discipline-specific  needs. To further explore these possibilities, we plan to administer our  survey to other colleges within the University. As Minnesota is one of  the few Big 10 Universities to institutionally separate the liberal arts  from sciences, comparing our results with other more  disciplinary-specific colleges should allow us to evaluate the roles  institutional organization and disciplinary expectations may play in the  emergence of data management needs and support.",

Those studies, 65 years ago, were the beginning of what is  now known as the American National Election Study (ANES). This poster  session will provide information on the history of the ANES, the  advances in the understanding of politics due to the study, and the  innovations that have come from the study. It will also present  information on the difficulties that arise in conducting a longitudinal  study of this nature and provide insight on how the ANES has worked to  adapt to the constantly changing world of research in the social  sciences.",

The Canard Question Module Editor is a free, open  source questionnaire design tool, that allows for the drag and drop  creation of rich questionnaires. Using the domain-specific and minimal  Simple Questionnaire Building Language [http://sqbl.org] as its target  language, Canard is able to support the transformation to numerous  formats using XSLT that allows for custom import and export  transformations. The minimal language and adherence to the principles of  Structured Questionnaire Design, mean that routing is predictable and  could be transformed into any format, as well as supporting real-time  updates to questionnaires during creation to provide designers with  functional example questionnaires and routing diagrams as they edit  content. Demonstrations will include: * Import/export functionality to  supporting standards including DDI Codebook and Lifecycle, CS-Pro, HTML  and PDF. * Design of multilingual content supporting any number of  languages, and checking for gaps in translations. * Live previewing of  surveys including complex routing and filtering. * Drag-and-drop  creation of routing logic, word substitutions and derived data elements.  * Automatic creation of questionnaire metadata, including the creation  of flowcharts illustrating respondent routing.",

For the META-SSS project, Metadata Technology North America focused on modernizing the metadata for the ANES and GSS studies, developing automated processes to clean and combine information from multiple sources, to produce accurate and robust DDI 2.5 files. These metadata are then in turn used to drive a new discovery portal aiming at increasing user efficiency by allowing them to quickly investigate study components, access documentation, and create data subsets. Open search and retrieval web services underlying the portal are also available to developers for driving other related tools or web applications. This presentation will outline the procedures used to create structured metadata and will display some of the tools created for the Metadata Portal.",

While originally a new, extra phase added on after the  traditional data collection of data, metadata are now recognized to be  an integral and integrated part of conducting survey research.  Increasingly, it is possible to extract metadata during the survey  research work flow as it unfolds, to retain that information, and to  append it to the collected data at the end of the survey research cycle.  The goal is to develop a series of procedures so that via the use of  DDI metadata, surveys can be designed, collected, documented, and  released as part of one seamless process rather than as a series of  loosely-related, stop-and-go steps. This presentation will provide  recommendations for changes to existing workflows to accomplish this  goal.",

It was built as a demonstrator in DSpace by EDINA and Data Library and  has been given new life by the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Research Data  Management initiative. Following testing by pilot users in various  departments last year, DataShare is confirmed as a key RDM service.   Since 2008 much external infrastructure has grown around data sharing,  and software developers, publishers and librarians are creating new  innovations around the sharing and re-use of data daily. How can  DataShare be shaped to fit in to this ever-more-sophisticated  environment? A number of ongoing developments are helping us integrate  the repository in the global context. DataShare is being indexed in  Thomson-Reuter\u2019s Data Citation Index. We aspire to attain the Data Seal  of Approval for DataShare, a badge that confers trustworthiness through  peer review. It is listed in re3data.org and databib registries of data  repositories. We offer via extension, peer review of datasets to our  depositors by listing journals that publish \u2018data papers\u2019 such as F1000  Research.  Locally, as Information Services builds new data services  such as the Data Store, [private data] Vault and the [metadata-only]  Register, we can focus DataShare on its named purpose.",

This presentation will include examples from eight universities  (including our own institution) that characterize the approach, method  and strategy that each institution has applied to the process of  developing RDM support programs. We focus on the prominent role of the  library in educating and assisting researchers with managing their data  throughout the research lifecycle. Based on these examples, we construct  timelines for each institution depicting key events and milestones over  the course of building support for RDM, and we discuss similarities and  differences among universities in motivation to provide RDM support,  collaborations among campus units, assessment of needs and services, and  changes in staffing. Our case studies will help to outline how academic  libraries have generally articulated the conceptual foundations, roles,  and responsibilities involved in RDM, while highlighting the specific  ways in which we have used research findings to improve the four key RDM  areas: 1) Education, awareness, and community building; 2)  Infrastructure; 3) Policy and strategy; and 4) Consultation and  services. Our findings should provide useful insights for other  institutions that are considering or in the progress of developing RDM  services.",

We discuss types of restructuring needed, utilizing in part  the experience of the University of California, Irvine, Libraries, in  establishing an E-Research  Digital Scholarship Services component,  but also analyzing the changes at other research libraries as they  grapple with the new mandate to make research data more accessible, and  all that implies.    We also analyze recent job announcements to  illustrate how the profession of social science data librarian has  changed and the recruitment implications.   No longer is it sufficient  for us to just help academic users find datasets for secondary analysis.   Rather, our roles have changed inasmuch as many of us may become  active collaborators with faculty during the research life cycle. Not  only must research data be aligned with research infrastructure but the  traditional liaison model of social science librarianship needs to be  enhanced or restructured. We discuss various strategies underway so that  libraries can actively participate in the global data ecosystem.",

The OCDO started operations with a small staff of data  management professionals who traditionally supported the research  function and now must shift gears to provide data services to a broader  base of users and a wider range of analytical work.  New  infrastructures, programs, processes and staffing are being developed  and deployed to ensure that data needs across the lifecycle are met and  that a variety of analytical approaches can be supported.",

We know that many of our users are less the passive consumer  and more the engaging contributor and that this shift will likely  continue as younger cohorts become data professionals. Our planned user  portfolio seeks to harness this new mood by, among other things, giving  users the opportunity to: (1) create a public profile, incorporating  other IDs (e.g., LinkedIn, ORCID); (2) make their current and past  research projects more visible;  (3) upload and share syntax/code;  (4)  comment, tag and add content on blogs, resources, records;  (5) provide  advice to other users;  (6) store and share links to searches, resources  etc.  This presentation outlines the approach being taken by the UK  Data Service \u2013 from an evaluation of needs through to technical  implementation \u2013 and provides the planned timetable for delivery.",

The system  centers around the storage and re-use of syntax files. Syntax may  describe filtering processes, weighing schemes, data harmonization and,  of course, the data analyze that leads ultimately to the publication of  scientific insight. Sharing it is the only way to achieve consistency in  results over a group of people. We will also shortly explore some of  the challenges involved in syntax metadata and how some it can be  extracted semi-automatically. From this starting point, we will argue  that to re-produce results in scientific publications, we not only  need  the starting point of the research data used, but also the  documentation of how this data was transformed into the numbers that we  read in the paper.

                    "abstract": "With the beginning of this year DATORIUM, the data sharing repository of  the Data Archive of GESIS \u2013 Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences  in Germany has gone online at http://datorium.gesis.org/.  It enables researchers to manage their research datasets, document  basic study level information, and publish their data and structured  metadata on a single web-based platform. The metadata schema of datorium  is compatible with other current metadata schemata in the area like  DataCite, da|ra, and DDI-Lifecycle. Datasets in DATORIUM may be shared  with others according to the needs of the researchers and they get  assigned a DOI name so that other users can cite the source and give  credit to the primary data collectors. In general, DATORIUM encourages  the use of open licenses that make the data available for a broad number  of purposes and to the widest possible audience. Alternatively,  researches can use more restricted licenses if privacy issues or other  restrictions do apply. In any case, DATORIUM provides a medium-term data  availability and makes the datasets citable. As an addition, long-term  archiving of the data can be achieved by using the standard archiving  services of the GESIS Data Archive.",

Looking to the future, the rapid proliferation  of data and emerging technologies in the research community will cause  foreseeable pressure on the Center\u2019s aging systems, processing workflows  and limited resource allocation.   In response to these challenges, the  Roper Center, guided by consultant Ann Green, began \u201cA Review and  Redesign of Roper Center Infrastructure\u201d in 2011 with funding provided  by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The project initiated with an  internal review of operations as well as an environmental scan of  standards and practices in the digital curation field. Based on this  collaborative effort, Green developed a detailed report including a  framework and recommendations to facilitate institutional changes.   The  Roper Center team is developing a new single-stream, DDI-compliant data  processing infrastructure that will streamline quality review of  incoming public opinion materials. By implementing a more policy-driven  and standards-based workflow, the Center will ensure the long-term  preservation of and improve access to our materials. This presentation  will provide an overview of policy changes and technological  improvements the Roper Center has executed based upon its workflow  analysis and offer recommendations relevant to any institution  considering undergoing an internal review process.",

                    "abstract": "Enticing social science researchers to share their data has been  significantly improved given the contextual changes spurred by grant  foundations, associations, publishers, and government agencies.  One  major challenge is the documentation of the data.  Ideally, the  researcher would create the quality metadata that enables his/her data  to be discovered, and re-used correctly.  However, researchers often  lack the time, expertise, or support to create quality metadata.     Stanford University Libraries recently added the ability for researchers  to self-deposit their data in the University\u2019s Institutional Repository  (SDR, Stanford Digital Repository).  However, the metadata required for  many social science studies goes far beyond that supported by the SDR  self-deposit process.  Librarians, faculty, and developers at Stanford  have collaborated to try to address this issue via a Drupal-based web  site:  data.stanford.edu.  We will share our experiences, assessments,  and future plans.",

GIS collection development  within university libraries has evolved and advanced greatly as user  demands have increased and become more specialized. Most major  universities now either have a GIS specialist or a \u201cdata lab\u201d with  librarians. The push for addressing data at the university level,  whether its data collection, management, or storage, has become common  place. This presentation focuses on new and developing trends in users\u2019  demand for geospatial data. We will address questions and issues  concerning how these new demands impact academic libraries collection  development policies. In particular we focus on four issues:   A move  from macro data collections to more micro-oriented collections. Nature  of geospatial data. What structures are in place to provide access? Need  for policy guiding collection development for geospatial data. We give a  brief overview of the above issues and focus on the challenges that  have persisted through users\u2019 demand for geospatial data. The  presentation will look at the challenges through the lens of two  specific case studies: the University of California, Los Angeles at  Charles E. Young Research Library and the University of Southern  California, Los Angeles, GeoPortal.",

With the birth of the new service, we set about  repurposing, as well as creating new content that met the needs of the  UK Data Service. This presentation will discuss our approach to  supporting our users with high quality and relevant materials within our  website. These materials include dataset guides, videos, and  slide-packs for teaching, as well as other web resources. In addition,  we discuss how we have repurposed materials from webinars to reach a  larger audience. We also discuss the steps taken to create these  materials, practicalities and the lessons learnt, as well as our future  plans.",

                    "abstract": "Effective knowledge dissemination of population survey results benefit  the end user when results are engaging and visually appealing, as they  enhance understanding and move research into action. In 2011, the CIHR  Social Research Centre in HIV Prevention (SRC) at the University of  Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health and the Canadian Foundation  for AIDS Research (CANFAR) conducted a national population health  survey to gain a better understanding of Canadians\u2019 behaviours,  attitudes, knowledge and perceptions of HIV and AIDS.  To maximize the  dissemination of these survey results, the team was funded by a Canadian  Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant to build a prototype for an  open source (or open access or non proprietorial) web-based data  visualization tool.  The interactive tool visualizes the survey data  using both spatial and non-spatial elements and utilizes both Drupal and  Google map and charts scripts. The tool is currently undergoing  evaluation by its target knowledge users, which are staff at  organizations that provide HIV and AIDS-related services across Canada.  Future plans are to further build-out non-spatial visualization  components as well as add additional data to the platform.  This project  involves a multi-disciplinary collaboration between public health  researchers, geographers, librarians and professionals from  community-based AIDS organizations.  This session will describe the  process of developing the data visualization tool; share the results  from the evaluation data collected ; and discuss the challenge of  designing a tool that engages users through an easily accessible and  visually pleasing representation without losing the multidimensional  complexity of the data.",

                    "abstract": "Data visualization has become an increasingly important part of working  with research data. While universities, libraries and data providers are  investing in data and visualization infrastructure, the term now  encompass a broadening range of activities from the design of graphics  for publication to real time rendering of terabytes of data in  interactive 3D environments.  Librarians are increasingly being asked to  participate and support research data visualization, but the breadth of  the landscape creates difficulties for developing services and meeting  campus expectations around visualization. As libraries and academic  institutions develop infrastructure, support and services for  visualization, we will need to both understand the complexity of the  broad space of visualization and strategically develop scalable support  for a diversity of types of visualization. The range of activities that  constitute visualization each have unique economies of scale and  cultural practices that directly influence our ability to provide  support. This presentation will attempt to describe the diversity of the  academic visualization landscape and building on our experiences at the  University of Michigan will suggest some of the opportunities and  challenges provided by providing library support for data visualization.",
