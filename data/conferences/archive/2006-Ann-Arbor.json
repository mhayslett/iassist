                    "abstract": "This workshop is Part 1 of a two-part workshop, with the second part  offered in the afternoon as Workshop 5 (Hands-On DDI 3.0 - Concept,  Structure, and Tools).  DDI Version 3.0 is currently under review by the DDI Expert Committee and expected to move into public review following the DDI meeting during IASSIST. This long-anticipated move toward a modular approach based on the data life cycle brings increased coverage of comparative data, an instrumentation/questionnaire module, and data management provisions. The new version also raises questions as to what it means for current users of DDI 1 or 2 and what it means for data archivists and programmers. This two-part workshop will cover the broad questions of version differences, new 3.0 features, and the future of the DDI and data documentation (Part 1, Workshop 1, classroom format), and then address the practical aspects of migration to 3.0, metadata creation, and available tools (Part 2, Workshop 5, lab format). Attendees can register for the full-day workshop or either half-day session, depending on their needs and interests.  Topics to be covered: Conceptual differences between DDI and traditional documentation (including codebooks and DDI 1 and 2)Utility, functionality, and uses of DDI (parse-ability,  re-usability, flexibility, use over the life cycle of data,  human-usable documentation, software-usable documentation, metadata  as data, etc.), with many examplesKey features of DDI 3DDI LiteThe future of DDI and data documentation  Intended Audience: Anyone interested in DDI; no prior  knowledge of DDI or XML is required. The morning workshop will present  basic concepts of DDI.",

The workshop will cover the various steps that one needs to negotiate  in implementing an SDA archive. It will also show archivists how to use  some newly developed procedures that facilitate the addition of  datasets to an SDA archive.  Participants are encouraged to bring a data file (ASCII, fixed  columns) and a matching DDI file to the workshop (on a diskette or a  CD). They will be able to install that dataset on an SDA site for online  analysis. Various other test files will be provided.

The W.M. Keck Statistical Literacy Project developed a Web-based drill program that decodes students' descriptions and comparisons and gives users feedback on their errors. Students for whom English is not their native language may find this program very helpful. This statistical literacy learning object may be useful to students in the social sciences who need to be able to communicate statistical summaries involving rates and percentages. The goal of this workshop is to introduce users to the online program as a learning object. Those who complete this workshop should have the material they need to duplicate this workshop at their home institution.  Intended Audience: Individuals interested in statistical literacy.",

On the one hand, the proliferation of information can challenge even seasoned professionals, while presenting a daunting array of possibilities to a newcomer in the field. On the other hand, the latest news and information about data can sometimes be quite well-hidden. This presentation will examine sources and strategies for balancing the flow of data-news while keeping abreast of news and developments in the field.

The collection, maintenance, and upkeep of more than 50,000 time series from more than 60 sources in a central location are daunting tasks; the documenting of the metadata for the compilation and use of these data are even more so. We are currently building a comprehensive metadata repository that links three kinds of metadata about our time series: structural metadata describing the series themselves; reference metadata describing the collection and construction of the aggregate time series by the issuing agency; and operational metadata documenting our procedures for retrieving, processing, and maintaining the data. Many of the pieces to the puzzle currently exist in a disparate array of formats: attributes in a proprietary database, HTML pages on a Web site, Word documents buried on a file server, etc. We are bringing these pieces of information together in a relational database setting to allow users to search for and see all the relevant metadata for a particular series or economic concept. In addition, we have the challenge of making the entries time-sensitive to accommodate the library of vintage or \"real time\" data we are building for future research.",

Appropriate metadata need to be  integrated with the archive material to help users find and identify  relevant content. Candidate metadata elements were selected from the  DDI. User studies will be performed to verify that the selected metadata  elements help users search successfully. Initial studies will elicit  descriptions of metadata that users want to see associated with archival  material, compare those choices with the candidate DDI elements, and  revise the set if appropriate. Then users will test the revised metadata  in realistic scripted searches of the archive. The talk will describe  the project, the selection process for the metadata elements, and the  methods and results of early user studies.",

The schema draws on other metadata standardization efforts including DDI, ISO1179, SDMX, and NIEM. In addition to schema development, we are undertaking user studies to better understand how the schema can best facilitate end-user discovery activities. By the time of the IASSIST meeting, we will have completed schema development and testing, and be engaged in user studies.

There is no practice of regular household surveys at the government level in Russia. The first household-based survey, National Survey of Households Well-being and Participation in Social Programs, took place in 2003 and covered 45,000 households in 46 Russian regions. It includes 227 variables aggregated to 13 parts. These survey results are the initial data holdings downloaded into the database. Our database provides for almost the full range of services under the Harvard-MIT Data Center's Virtual Data Center and SDA Archive. In the second stage of our project other resources developed in Russia and in international research centers will be included. The most famous project is the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, which covers 13 nationally representative surveys beginning in 1992, conducted by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in collaboration with the Russian Federal Statistics Agency and several Russian institutes. As a next stage of our project knowledge products will be integrated. An ontology to provide for content-based indexing and search is under construction.University Information System RUSSIA (UIS RUSSIA, www.cir.ru) has been designed and is maintained as a digital thematic library for research and education in economics and the social sciences, in operation since January 2000. The most requested module is RF state statistics. Value-added services for economic and social statistics is a main direction of the UIS RUSSIA development. In 2005 we began to create a database for investigations of life quality and economic welfare of households and individuals. The primary survey that is downloaded to the database is the National Survey of Households Well-being and Participation in Social Programs. The survey took place in 2003 and covered 45,000 households in 46 Russian regions. It includes 227 variables aggregated to 13 parts. While working on the database we investigated the experience of Harvard-MIT Data Center's Virtual Data Center and SDA Archive.",

As such, it is expected that DANS will have to ingest and manage a very large number of datasets. The traditional process of data archiving, i.e., having archivists enter extensive metadata for each incoming dataset, is likely to put a strain on personnel entering the metadata. DANS is setting up a two-stage archival process which will be able to cope with large amounts of submissions. In the first phase, nicknamed Easy-Store, datasets will be archived in a simple yet robust archival system. The second stage, called Deep-Store, will go into the details of a dataset and will only be executed for particular datasets. The paper will focus on the specifics of the Easy-Store system. We will give an overview of the concepts, the requirements, the architecture, temporary results, possibilities and future work on the system, and we'll have a first evaluation of the place the system takes in the two-stage archival process.",

                    "abstract": "An overlooked section of the digital data life cycle is that of metadata entry. Too often, records are populated by copying and pasting from one form to another; and frequently updating Web pages are given to non-Web editors to revise. Rational and efficient management and development of the 'back office', which feeds the information end users see, is often not a high organisational priority. This paper highlights the strategy ESDS has used to make cataloguing and Web page updates straightforward. There is an almost seamless transition from data deposit forms to catalogue records, lessening the possibility of errors. Databases are used for updating of events, online booking, news, and staff pages with information input through a simple interface appearing on Web pages instantly. All of these make repetitive tasks obsolete and leave time for staff to concentrate on more interesting matters.",

SQUAD is a demonstrator project funded under the ESRC Qualitative Data Archiving and Dissemination Scheme (QUADS). The project is exploring methodological and technical solutions for exposing digital qualitative data to make them fully shareable and exploitable. First, the project deals with specifying and testing non-proprietary means of storing and marking up data using universal (XML) standards and technologies, and proposes an XML community standard (schema) that will be applicable to most qualitative data. The second strand investigates optimal requirements for contextualising research data (e.g., interview setting or interviewer characteristics), aiming to develop standards for data documentation and ways of capturing this information. The third strand aims to use natural language processing technology to develop and implement user-friendly tools for semi-automating processes to prepare qualitative data (format and mark-up using TEI) for both digital archiving and linking with other kinds of Web-enabled data and information sources. We will demonstrate some early versions of graphic user interfaces to natural language processing tools, including the data anonymising tool.",

The Canadian Embassy funded the pilot project, the result of which is Canadian iPOLL (CPOLL). This paper discusses the decision-making and collaboration in creating this resource. The design of CPOLL is built upon experiences garnered from two other Roper Center databases: iPOLL (U.S. opinion data) and JPOLL (Japanese opinion data). Collaboration with Canadian data experts assured understanding of cultural nuances, political processes, and the nature of data collection in Canada. The paper addresses efforts to assure consistency in the development of metadata, including coding of topics of coverage, and the decisions involving the selection process, from time period for inclusion to assuring a broad set of sources. Finally, this paper explores the lessons learned from this endeavor and implications for further facilitating cross-national opinion research and creating multiple country databases in the future.",

It examines how data availability and accessibility have changed with improvements in information technology and globalization and it assesses the impact of these changes on  cross-national crime research. It ends with suggestions for improving access and usage of these data and gives examples of important research and policy questions that could be answered with better cross-national crime and justice data.",

Poppleton, P.  Williamson, J, 2004, Oxford, UK: Symposium Books). We further analyze and compare the responses teachers gave to a semi-structured interview including an open-ended questionnaire about political, economic, administrative, and curricular changes in their work-lives. Guidelines developed by cognitive linguists are utilized in order to compare (1) how teachers describe educational change in six of the nine countries, (2) what teachers' language teaches us about the meaning of educational change in different countries, (3) what similarities and differences are used for concrete concepts describing teachers' work-lives, and (4) how the qualitative data complement and underscore the quantitative data.",

The ARDA archives data on 238 different countries and territories including ARDA-coded measures from the US State Department's annual International Religious Freedom Reports. The data also include social scientific surveys such as the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Country-specific data will also be archived, e.g., ABC poll data from Afghanistan. Finally, this paper describes the way the ARDA \"democratizes\" accesses to these freely downloadable data by making them available with online analysis options.

Open access can not only benefit scientific research, but also  facilitate the application of scientific results to pressing problems of  environment and development and support the evolution of an equitable  and open information society. CODATA, the Committee on Data for Science  and Technology of the International Council for Science, launched a  Global Information Commons for Science initiative at the November 2005  World Summit on the Information Society. The objective of the initiative  is to coordinate and promote a range of national and international open  access efforts, and in particular to provide leadership on key  international data policy issues. This paper will highlight a range of  open access activities and also address other pressing science data  management issues facing the scientific community such as long-term  preservation.",

There is a distinct set of problems  emerging around the issues posed by scientific data online. First,  current expansions in intellectual property law could generate an  entirely new set of obstacles to sharing data among scientists or with  the public. Second, the congruence of Web-enabled database access with  the widespread availability of rapid, low-cost gene sequencing and  abstract, engineerable biological parts has had an unforeseen effect:  there is growing uncertainty of how to store, distribute, license, and  provide functional information to specify genetic function under the  law. Third, there is a wasteful data economy evolving in which raw data  are not made accessible; scientists are either leery of the risks of  losing control over their data or subject to institutional requirements  that mandate a closed approach.",

This presentation focuses on incentives for sharing and on technological and legal mechanisms to support incentives for sharing. It outlines a conceptual model and the accompanying research challenges for providing easy legal and technological mechanisms by which any creator might affirmatively and permanently mark and make accessible a location-referenced dataset such that the world knows where the dataset came from and that the data are available for use without the law assuming that the user must first acquire permission.",

The action plan aims at the improvement of the ICT capacity to support the development of a Central Databank, the establishment of a socioeconomic database, and the implementation of a user-friendly dissemination system. To ensure compliance with international practices, we have adopted the World Bank Microdata Management Toolkit as a standard tool and therefore use the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) specification as the basis for the compilation of the metadata and micro-level data.

Because it is of great value for the scientific community, there is a need for knowledge transfer from the federal office to the scientific community. MISSY offers the metadata both in a broad and differentiated way. MISSY takes different aspects of data documentation into account: The central part of the sample and data description are based on DDI (Data Documentation Initiative). Furthermore, additional information concerning methodical and scientific subjects are integrated to improve the usability of the Microcensus. Another aspect is related to the organization of information: related metadata in MISSY is linked in multiple ways, guided by different views on the subject. In addition, different possibilities for access facilitate the search of information and consider different needs and skills of scientists. The presentation will introduce the structure of MISSY.",

A staunch advocate for\ndata sharing and access, Pat wrote extensively on confidentiality and\ndisclosure issues in microdata. We remember not only Pat's many\nprofessional contributions but also her vibrant personality and spirit.</p>\n\n<p>The main presentation in this plenary will focus on \"Optimizing the Use\nof Microdata: An Overview of the Issues.\" Julia Lane will discuss the\ntwo substantial challenges that face collectors and producers of\neconomic data: The first is how can the information derived from vast\nstreams of data on human beings be used while protecting\nconfidentiality? The second is the essence of good science: how can\nsociety best provide and promote access to rich and sensitive data so\nthat empirical results can be generalized and replicated?</p>\n\n<p>Julia Lane is a Senior Vice President and Director of Economics, Labor\nand Population Studies at the National Opinion Research Center\nat the University of Chicago and a Senior\nResearch Fellow at the U.S. Bureau of the Census. She was previously an\nEconomics Program Director at the National Science Foundation. She is\nthe author of Confidentiality, Disclosure and Data Access: Theory and\nPractical Applications for Statistical Agencies (North Holland, 2001),\ncoedited with Pat Doyle, Laura Zayatz and Jules Theeuwes.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Groves is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Survey\nResearch Center in the Institute for Social Research at the University\nof Michigan. Dr. Groves studies how alternative research designs affect\nthe utility of data collected. He is an investigator on a Survey\nResearch Center-ICPSR project on \"Human Subject Protection and\nDisclosure Risk Analysis\" funded by NICHD.</p>\n\n<p>Cynthia Cook is Southwestern Ontario Regional Supervisor of the\nStatistics Canada Research Data Centre Program. The Research Data\nCentres (RDC) program is part of an initiative by Statistics Canada, the\nSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and university\nconsortia to help strengthen Canada's social research capacity and to\nsupport the policy research community.</p>\n\n<p>Judith Rowe retired after more than 30 years managing data and\nstatistical services at Princeton University. During that period she\nserved as President of both IASSIST and APDU and as chair of COPAFS as\nwell as a member of the Depository Library Council and of numerous ALA\ncommittees, including the Subcommittee that wrote the initial rules for\nthe cataloging of computer files, the Census Advisory Committee, and the\nadvisory committee that recommended including computer materials as part\nof the depository library program.</p>\n\n\n<h3><a id=\"Plenary 3\" name=\"Plenary 3\"></a></h3>",

                    "abstract": "Data mining can be defined as exploration and analysis of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules. For numeric data the process of this discovery is either directed or non-directed based upon whether there is a fact that we wish to explain through models of explanatory variables, or there is a search for patterns that can prove useful. Text mining is a variation on the field of data mining. It is the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting and linking information from different textual sources. In both methods, automated processes help put together information to uncover new meanings or suggest new hypotheses to be explored further, typically by more conventional means of research. But what are the pros and cons of these methods and how does traditional social science data fit in? This joint paper will elaborate on the typologies of data and text mining, and provide examples and typical models that are relevant to social science and business data. The applicability for Data and Computational Grid applications (e-science) will also be highlighted.",

                    "abstract": "The approach usually taken when conceptualizing metadata is typically one of 'documentation', which supposes a reference object, e.g., data, and something to be told about it. That documentation is static; it describes data in a specific state, usually as ready for publication. The life-cycle idea introduces a new perspective. Sure, one can still reduce metadata to a report about what happened across  the life cycle of the data. But there is also an opportunity to model metadata in a way to support work done to obtain data, process, edit and publish them. The following example will be developed. Because we don't use the integrated tools for handling metadata and data all over the life cycle, consistency between the two levels of information may be broken. We need a metadata model, which supports the comparison of metadata drawn from more than one source, e.g., the questionnaire, treated as 'metadata by design', and information extracted from a semi-documented data file, an SPSS data file for example, which stands as the 'fielded metadata'.",

Are objects information? Do they contain information? Data are often defined in terms of information, vice versa, or in terms of some other undefined concept, such as knowledge. All this leads to much confusion. This paper is an attempt to shed light on these and related issues. Terminology theory is the study of concepts and their representations in special languages. It focuses on the essential characteristics of concepts, and therefore on what a concept is. Applying the theory, we define data in a new way, by defining what data is, by investigating its essential characteristics. This, in turn, provides a way to distinguish between data and information usefully. The role of metadata is clearly defined. Then, a definition of data element is derived. Implications for the Semantic Web are discussed.",

Such data are fully anonymised and certain variables may be suppressed or aggregated to minimise disclosure risk. However, there is a research need for more detailed data, such as more precise geographic and occupation codes. To increase the range of data available for research, whilst continuing to safeguard the confidentiality pledge made to survey respondents, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UKDA, and ESDS Government have developed a Special Licence (SL) and an associated guide to good practice. A range of more detailed ONS data are now available via this new access initiative.

These solutions involved a mixture of broad banding, perturbation, access controls, and differing levels of licensing. A range of microdata are now available. Very detailed files are held in a safe setting; users travel to a secure site and leave outputs to be checked before release. Less detailed files are disseminated to licensed users.

Calls have been made for systems ensuring that publicly funded research results remain in the public domain, adhering to Open Access values of no economic or use-restrictive barriers between knowledge and those who wish access to the same. These include the National Institutes of Health and Wellcome Trust efforts for biomedical research, the declaration from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for open access to publicly funded research, and the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society discussing the same. And advocacy organizations such as the Alliance for Taxpayer Access have emerged, working to ensure that these values are realized. This paper examines and discusses some of these actors in the Open Access movement and how they may be seen to touch on 'data'.",

                    "abstract": "For years the DDI has struggled with improving its ability to cover geographic information. Each of the past three revisions included new elements and attributes to address geography. The structural changes taking place in DDI 3.0 provided an opportunity to make major improvements in geographic information. A working group of the Expert Committee was formed to address the following needs: (1) Provide a means of describing geographic coverage that allows for more detail and better alignment with other description standards; (2) Describe geographic hierarchies and the relationship of those levels; and (3) Expand the ability to reference external maps and geographic data files (shape/boundary). The changes introduced in DDI 3.0 allow for improved description, searching, manipulating, and linking data based on geography. This presentation reviews what was changed, why it was done, and how it improves your ability to work with data.",

This concept is realized in DDI 3.0 by the grouping model. The application of the new model will be illustrated by a selected documentation example of the German Microcensus. The Microcensus is a representative annual population sample containing structural population data of 1 percent of all households in Germany. A synoptical table including all variables for selected years shows which variables are comparable over time. This approach facilitates the work with Microcensuses of multiple years. To represent variable inconsistency in DDI, the grouping model offers the possibility to define information as a standard on a top level and to capture variations or additions on a lower level. The presentation will highlight the realization of the grouping model concerning the comparability of variables over time. Opportunities and limitations of documentation with DDI 3.0 will be pointed out and appropriate technical designs will be presented.",

Preliminary work has focused on the  challenges of building an integrated information architecture that  consolidates workspace, content, and tools vital to scientific research  and specifically quantitative data. Using FEDORA architecture, a  proof-of-concept project involving demographic, climate, and traffic  data was developed to determine the challenges of ingesting datasets  with very different characteristics, allow variable-level extraction,  and provide standardized access to descriptive metadata at the variable  level. Examples from the project will be included.",

Of the  seven participating countries, only Norway and Switzerland have a  majority of their total populations able to function at a minimum level  for success in everyday numeric situations. A problem in developing a QL  program at the tertiary level is that it lacks a disciplinary home.  While there is general agreement within the academy that it is an  essential element of an overall education, no department appears willing  to make QL a part of its curriculum. In contrast, standards in  Information Literacy have been long-established and have gained wide  acceptance. This paper will examine the processes by which these  programs have become mainstream, and recommend approaches to develop a  QL framework based on best practices.",

                    "abstract": "Over the past nine years, many presentations, demonstrations, and workshops have been given at the four annual training sessions for the Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) across Canada. These sessions are rich in content and remain useful long after the initial presentation. However, if one were looking for a certain item, there was often a difficulty finding it because the material was stored in an ad hoc fashion and not archived in a central location. This became increasingly problematic for the trainers as the number of sessions grew. The Education Committee of the DLI was examining this issue and the idea of a Training Repository (TR) was born. The enthusiastic responses given at the latest training sessions, which introduced the TR, reaffirmed the need for it. And everyone was pleased to see the ease of retrieving a session. Currently there are over 150 presentations in the TR. This presentation examines the history of the Training Repository, the criteria used to choose the program that houses it, and the processes used to populate it.",

The survey focused on reading informal statistics rates and percentages in tables and graphs. Some high error rates were encountered. In reading a 100 percent row table, 44 percent of students (28% of professionals) misread a description of a single percentage. In reading a pie chart, 68 percent of students (53 percent of professionals) misread a comparison of two slices. In reading an X-Y plot, 81 percent of college teachers misread a \"times more than\" comparison.

ESS EduNet is a resource that unites different elements of social science in pursuit of a common goal -- the achievement of more penetrating and better-founded analysis of attitudinal survey data than hitherto. The intention is to create an environment for learning that challenges the students on theoretical, methodological, and practical issues simultaneously. Our hope is to improve the students' knowledge of a range of different approaches to social scientific analysis, stimulate independent thinking, and offer them the technical means of investigating empirical data and interpreting results. ESS EduNet is funded by the European Commission as a part of Round Two of the European Social Survey, and developed by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services.

Experience shows that current incentives  are insufficient to overcome the obstacles that data producers report to  providing complete and accurate documentation with their data. A  multidisciplinary team of experts in digital archiving, social science  research, and experimental economics at the School of Information and  ICPSR are investigating ways to increase cooperation between producers  and archives. With their government partner, the National Institute of  Justice, researchers use multiple methods (surveys and experiments) to  identify barriers to compliance, revise guidelines and responsibilities,  and develop and test alternative incentive mechanisms. This  presentation will report on initial findings from a survey about the  obstacles that data producers face when they deposit data in an archive.nbsp;",

To build an  effective digital preservation program, an institution requires a  three-legged stool consisting of an organizational infrastructure, a  technological infrastructure, and a resources framework. Based on the  \"Digital Preservation Management: Implementing Short-term Strategies to  Long-term Problems\" workshop and tutorial developed by Cornell  University Library, this paper reviews core components of a digital  preservation program, highlights key standards and documents (focusing  on Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities and  Open Archival Information System standard), describes a five-stage  maturity model for the incremental development of a digital preservation  program, and incorporates the results from institutional readiness  surveys completed by workshop participants.",

ICPSR, as part of the Data Preservation  Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS) project, has undertaken a  systematic review of grant awards made by NSF and NIH with a major goal  of determining the extent to which important social science data have  been collected, but not preserved or archived. We have found that the  majority of data collections produced by NIH and NSF awards have not  been archived. Our preliminary results from this project suggest that  there are many reasons that data are not archived. The benefits of  developing and implementing a data archiving plan at early parts of the  data life cycle will also be discussed.",

Focus in the social and policy  sciences has been on the stewardship of datasets that were generated as  part of the research process, whether in academic, government, or  commercial domains. The last decade or so has seen emergence of digitisation programmes  for 'born-again' digital surrogates, data-sharing in the life and  physical sciences, and corporate concerns with digital asset value and  legal compliance. There is now a confluence of institutional  repositories and self-publishing, with attempt to manage this within the  context of the evolution of digital library provision. These generate  challenges in terms of what constitutes best practice for those within  IASSIST who provide data for others to thresh. Key to this is  value-added activity, both in the curation of datasets for which there  is stewardship and in the delivery of services, re-working the mixed  mission of re-use, re-purposing, and historic record.  Examples will be drawn from the operation and forward planning for  Edinburgh University Data Library, EDINA National Data Centre, and the  Digital Curation Centre.",

Among other things, the project resulted in a Web site with all the tables and the additional information. Furthermore several hundreds of the tables were scanned, OCR'd, and subsequently transformed into Excel tables. Recently we have conducted a preliminary investigation into alternative ways to disseminate the data, i.e., via Nesstar. This application offers the possibility to present geographical data in a map and conduct analyses and calculations online. But whereas the initial project's primary objective was to be as historically accurate as possible, data need to meet other requirements to be suitable for Nesstar. The presentation will cover the considerations that play a part in the decision about how to present the census data, the options that are available, and the problems that we encountered.",

Among the ways we would like to help satisfy the professional demands made on us during the anniversary is by creating new thematic 'mini-sites'. To prepare these thematic mini-sites, we have developed our contemporary-history databases further to enable archiving of historical documents found in archives and description and archiving of historical studies, and data linkages of existing database elements. The first mini-site, presenting the armed groups of Budapest in 1956, is being prepared in the spring of 2006. Plans are for a thematic historical narrative to provide the framework for the content development, complemented by several hundred pages of digitalized textual documents, memoirs, photo documents, bibliography, and sound documents. Each element or document in the development will concurrently form a separate document in the contemporary-history database, also searchable and usable outside this mini-site framework.",

Whenever  possible, we ask for transactional data rather than aggregated  statistics. Maintaining access to the data, including regular updates,  in the face of massive government reorganization, changing data systems,  and a changing political environment has proved to be a challenge. Over  the years, we have found it necessary to establish a series of  validation and verification procedures because the quality of the  underlying data systems varies. We merge in geographic, population, and  other contextual information that helps to provide a basis for  interpretation. This paper will cover some of the problems along with  the solutions we've developed in delivering information to lawyers and  journalists who often have little or no statistical background.",

These questionnaires enable  researchers to take questions that have been used in large scale surveys  for use in their own research work, thus ensuring that they do not  spend time re-inventing the wheel. The Qb also contains information on  social measurement in 21 substantive topic areas, and has numerous  resources relating to survey data collection methods. The resource is  free to all.",

The interviews revealed a range of concerns regarding the management and distribution of geospatial data. Key issues include establishing and maintaining formal agreements, managing intellectual property rights and restrictions associated with the data, protecting sensitive information and the confidentiality of locations revealed by the data, and shielding the organization from potential liabilities resulting from data distribution and use. Many organizations have found innovative ways to address specific issues, but none of those surveyed has fully addressed all of these challenges. Issues identified by the interviews have contributed to the development of a guide for practitioners and a data model identifying information elements to be recorded and maintained when managing geospatial data and related electronic records.",

                    "abstract": "Emerging technologies in the field of Web Service interoperability are accelerating development of \"Web-based GIS\" these days. In Japan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) launched the \"GIS Action Program\" to encourage the introduction of \"Integrated GIS\" into local governments. It is easy to imagine that Web Service technologies should be applied to Integrated GIS in the near future. However, there is no standard or guideline for information security regarding Geospatial Information Service in Japan. Also,  only a few studies have been done on these issues. Therefore, studies from viewpoints of information security are required in order to construct secure geospatial information services. In the beginning of this paper, I clarify issues of information security for geospatial information services on the Internet, then discuss information security requirements for \"Web-based\" geospatial information services in local government. Those issues are based on the current situation in Japan; however, they will be common with most of \"e-Government\" around the world.",

Understanding urban and regional processes such as labour markets, internal migration, and housing prices requires the temporal dimension of data on top of its spatial reference. Running an \"ordinary\" time series database is complex enough. It obviously needs further logistics when handling temporal data for a multi-national universe like IFS and WDI. However, organizing a database with a temporal dimension for a multi-layer geographic universe is highly ambitious. The presentation will discuss issues of spatial statistics and present a few tradeoffs among major factors: time series continuity, changing boundaries, harmonization of different classifications, and hierarchy of geographic divisions across time. Examples from Israel Geobase will illustrate the discussed tradeoffs.",

However, there is much more that can be done to encourage progress in proper data citation. Data centers can play a primary role in developing and promoting best practices related to these areas. CIESIN has developed a number of procedures and resources related to citations of online data and information products. This paper will outline these practices and resources, as well as discussing their potential for wider applicability.

                    "abstract": "Technology has changed the way that people seek information. We can access an unimaginable amount of information with our fingertips. Much social science data can be easily obtained on the Web. What are the processes and mechanisms behind those tabular social science data on the Web? What are the caveats associated with those well-packaged data? When users depend on search engines to find information, a data librarian needs to guide them to locate pertinent data in the information haystacks. Many data producers are using Web technology to disseminate their data. How are these changes affecting social science data libraries and their staffs? This paper examines the service shift in a social science data library over the last five years and presents its plan for the future.",

                    "abstract": "Bridges are rarely built in a day and often their foundations are hidden below the waterline where few are able to see. Building networks for data collections and services in a university community takes time and requires individuals who are willing to take it upon themselves to draft the schematics and collect the raw materials before bridges can be built between major organizations within the community. This paper focuses on the collaborative efforts of the University Libraries and the Population Research Institute at The Pennsylvania State University. We will discuss past and current initiatives that have been successful in laying the foundation for future initiatives including: resource authentication, collection building, and promotional activities. We will conclude with a discussion of ideas for future collaboration focusing on distributive reference services, team teaching and other potential partners. It is imperative that we present coherent and cohesive projects that are comprehensible to our organizations' administrators; therefore a considerable amount of thought and experimentation through informal collaboration is necessary beforehand. By developing a history of collaboration through doable and successful projects, visible bridges can be built between seemingly independent organizations within the university community.",

The data librarian was also the  map librarian so geospatial /GIS data became her responsibility as well.  Data (including geospatial data) services to faculty and students have  developed: FROM the past (1997-2003) when they were Library centred; low  profile, minimum resources for staff, equipment or computers; TO the  present (2003-2006) where they are university centred with a Geospatial,  Map and Data Centre, full time technician, server space and Web  delivery of some data; TO the future (200?) - provincially centred, with  the possibility of centrally archived and networked delivery of social  science and geospatial data to Ontario universities. Techniques used at  Ryerson to give data services sufficient profile to attract funding and  future scenarios being considered by the Ontario universities Data and  Map librarians' groups for province wide delivery will be examined.",

It will also encourage feedback from  the audience regarding successful promotion and outreach activities at  other institutions.",
