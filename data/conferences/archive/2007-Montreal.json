                    "abstract": "The area of interaction between output       (research publication) repositories and source (primary research data)       repositories was the principal focus of the StORe project. The main aim of       the project was to identify options for increasing the value of using both       source and output repositories by improving the linkages between them,       thereby increasing the potential from significantly enhanced information       access and dissemination. A key deliverable from the StORe Project is the       pilot demonstrator.nbsp; It consists of a set of middleware designed to       demonstrate the function of bi-directional links between source and output       repositories. This middleware was developed to meet the specific needs of       the social science e-research community, but is based on the underlying       general requirements as defined from the StORe survey of the behaviours of       researchers within seven scientific disciplines represented by the       project. The pilot demonstrates the implementation of enhanced       functionality within a test environment and the potential for a generic       solution across the UK\u2019s broader e-research community. A short time hence,       in a hyperspace not so far away, researchers will be able to instantly       move from any publication to the data on which its findings were based, to       instantly be linked to all publications that have resulted from a       particular dataset and to move seamlessly around the research environment       of data and its outputs.",

What distinguishes this system from       other archiving systems is the possibility for researchers to deposit       datasets themselves, to customize the presentation of the dataset in the       system and to control who will get access to the datasets. This       presentation will present the results of the systems usage evaluation       which has taken place in June of 2006, from which we can draw conclusions       on the feasibility of having researchers depositing and archiving data       themselves. Moreover, it will go into the numerous ways in which this       web-application can be modified and customized without having to change       the original programs source files, making it relatively simple to       implement for organizations with very specific archiving system       requirements.",

Social bookmarking tools, like       Del.icio.us and Furl, provide a way to liberate your bookmarks from your       computer, allowing you and others to access them.nbsp; Social bookmarking       tools extend the possibilities of sharing resources through \"tagging,\u201d       allowing users to organize resources and contribute to a system that       reveals how exactly users think about the resources at hand. In this       session, hear about current experiments with social bookmarks and tags and       find out about how IASSIST can use these technologies to create a more       interactive community of data providers, users, and seekers.",

It is also recommended that       a Task Force be created to prepare a full national implementation       strategy.nbsp; Once such a national strategy is broadly supported, it is       proposed that a dedicated national infrastructure, tentatively called Data       Canada, be established, to assume overall leadership in the development       and execution of a strategic plan.",

The study is being undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team at       the University of Edinburgh and involves a survey of both social science       lecturers and researchers, and managers of information services within       Scottish Universities, to identify barriers and needs.nbsp; The scoping       study is being conducted against a backdrop of longstanding and widespread       concern about a UK-wide deficit in quantitative skills amongst social       scientists. The funders recognise the need to develop quantitative skills       amongst social scientists; and that this needs to take place during the       earliest stages of career development. ",

The UIS RUSSIA is       maintained as an integrated resource with content-based searching across       collections. The technology for automatic linguistic text processing       (ALTP, special software-lingware-knowledgeware complex) was designed,       developed and implemented within the framework of the project. The       technology is customized to process all main types of business prose       documents. Documents in English may be also processed and cross-searched,       exploiting bilingual (Russian-English) search tools. A short summary in       Russian accompanies a document in English. Journal of Economic Literature       (JEL)-based searching is implemented and is currently being tested on the       full-text SocioNet module which maintains publications on economic and       social sciences in English available via links in the Research Papers in       Economics (RePEc; www.repec.edu) electronic library; the collection covers       30000+ articles. In 2007, the UIS RUSSIA team plans to integrate foreign       universities' and think-tank publications in English. Search in English       across UIS RUSSIA holdings (in Russian) is completed. ",

While data librarians already face extraordinary       issues and challenges, business librarians\u2019 situations are even more so       such that data librarians often shy away from dealing with business       data-related issues. This paper assesses the current situation in selected       Canadian libraries including trends in the demand for business data and       what it means to librarians working with business schools as their       programs gain popularity. It emphasizes the unique nature of business data       used in traditional scholarly research as well as in professional fields       which are unique from a data service point of view. It includes a brief       demonstration of the most popular business data sources and their use. The       paper explores the detachment between traditional data library services       and business data services, examines the implications of this disconnect       for reference and collection development, and discusses viable options for       bridging the divide.

If not creating true open data resources, the MRC's policy       involves opening up access to previously (relatively) inaccessible       life-course data. To this end, the MRC is currently running a pilot       project designed to test the feasibility of preparing and making data more       widely available from the accomplished 1946 British Birth Cohort Study,       and the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD). Using Nesstar as       the data sharing tool, the pilot aims to evaluate the costs and benefits       of opening up access to the NSHD data and to document lessons learned that       may inform similar activities in the bio-medical area undertaken in the       future. Special attention is given to the particularities of opening up       access to a long-running longitudinal study which, due to the age of the       study, has traditionally been poorly-documented, and to balancing likely       increased scientific outputs with risk of disclosure. Among the key       scientific outputs that the project is interested in examining is the       feasibility of researchers sharing new variables derived from the       study.",

This vision, however, is accompanied by various legal and       ethical problems. One such problem is the question of access. While the       use of open data within the health service offers considerable advantages,       issues such as confidentiality need to be taken into account. Many       patients still expect the traditional model of care with doctor-patient       confidentiality, however, this is hard to equate with the reality of       extended health care teams where the need for data sharing and open access       to patient data has grown considerably. This paper will provide an       overview of the problems of how open the data sharing can, be using       several scenarios to provide examples and highlight some of the options       being considered.

This paper will       outline its position within the UK research arena discussing how, by       establishing a tiered licensing model, the UKDA has ensured that the       concerns of the depositors, data creators and the needs of its user       communities are sated. Two major issues will be discussed: the need for       establishing networks and relationships of trust and symbiosis; and       building and nurturing expertise and support required to establish a       workable legal framework under which data curation and sharing can       operate.",

The purpose of       this paper is to share our experiences and perspectives in helping       researchers obtain, house, and maintain access to restricted-use       data.nbsp; We hope that sharing some of our trials, tribulations and       triumphs will help inform those in the data community who are considering       offering restricted-data support. In six years with PRI as Data Archivist,       Jennifer Darragh helped the number of contracts grow from four in 2000, to       sixteen by 2006. In just three short months, PRI's new Data Archivist,       Kiet Bang, has had to learn how to manage these contracts (additions,       removals, renewals, custodial transfers) and coordinate with other       essential PRI staff to keep restricted data projects running smoothly.

In parallel, efforts are under way to investigate the       characteristics and potential for creating a science commons based on open       access to data and advanced information technology. CIESIN, the Center for       International Earth Science Information Network, through its NASA-funded       Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), is experimenting with       incorporating creative commons licensing into its publicly-available data       and information products. This paper will describe the issues CIESIN has       encountered surrounding implementing CC licensing as part of a data center       dissemination strategy. Particular focus will be on the challenges of       using a creative commons approach within an academic context and on the       potential benefits for end-users.",

The DLI wants to inform its communities of the content of       their holdings and then help them to access the data. And thus, the       Compleat DLI Survival Kit was born. This presentation will give the       background of the Compleat DLI Survival Kit and look at each of the       chapters in some detail.

                    "abstract": "DDI Version 3.0 provides new features to       document more complex studies, like collections of datasets and their       relationship between themselves. The presentation will focus on the       documentation of the central structure of German Socio-Economic Panel       Study (SOEP), especially the linkage between the panel waves and the       household/person relationship. The application of DDI 3.0 will be       illustrated by selected documentation examples. As DDI 3.0 will be       published in the first half of this year, this paper can only be a report       on the early attempt to document complex panel studies like SOEP with DDI       3.0. The study we use is the German SOEP, a representative longitudinal       study of private households in Germany which currently consists of more       than 260 single datasets. It provides information on household level and       on personal level over time. The Panel was started in 1984 in West Germany       and was expanded as early as June 1990 to include the states of the former       German Democratic Republic, even before the reunification. Some of the       many topics include household composition, occupational biographies,       employment, earnings, health, and satisfaction indicators. The data are       available to researchers in Germany and abroad.",

This approach enables efficient sharing of metadata in one organization or       over several organizations. DDI 3.0 resources can form the basis for a       variable registry, for persistent sources of metadata. The documentation       structure of a variable in DDI 3.0 is related to the metadata registry       standard ISO 11179. Using standard variables in DDI resources can       facilitate comparison of collection of studies. The ISCO variable is used       to illustrate these new possibilities of DDI. DDI Version 3.0 will be       published in the first half of this year. The International Standard       Classification of Occupation (ISCO) is a standard variable for organizing       jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and       duties undertaken in the job. The classification has four nested levels of       codes representing the categories of occupations. ISCO is used in major       studies like ISSP, GSS, ESS, and Eurobarometer. ISCO is developed by the       International Labour Organization (ILO).",

                    "abstract": "The presentation summarizes       a paper commissioned by Human Resources and Social Development Canada to       examine the present status and future prospects of the Data Documentation       Initiative (DDI) as a basis for improving the provision and exchange of       policy-actionable data and knowledge in Canada. The paper takes the       perspective of a major investor in the DDI, and is written in two parts.              Part 1 provides an introduction to the       DDI for researchers and knowledge workers. It describes the current state       of the standard, its implementation in software tools, and the adoption of       such tools in Canada's universities and governments. It introduces Version       3 and associated issues. Although there are some encouraging signs, the       evidence suggests that the DDI is fragile, has not yet achieved much       return on investment, and is taking on considerable risk. Part 2       introduces some of the difficulties in implementing standards for       statistical metadata. It outlines the essential elements for a successful       DDI: a)the standard; provision of metadata and content according to that       standard, b) provision of sustainable, industrial-strength metadata       management, web server, and 'killer' end-user applications to make it so,       c) and close co-ordination among the elements to focus limited resources       on the achievement of strategic goals. Part 2 provides an assessment of       the status of the DDI for each element.        The paper concludes that investments in the various components that       comprise the DDI are asynchronous with the realities of the standard's       overall implementation, take-up and payoffs. There appears to be almost no       coordination between the elements, and little recognition among those       working in each area of the interdependence of their efforts. The paper       proposes that a meeting take place between key actors to initiate better       coordination processes, and makes interim suggestions for action by       each.",

Most often the research investigations within       the broad area of social science have as their normal research objects the       human subjects. The validity of the results obtained through this design       is greatly affected by the coloring in obtaining socially desirable       answers as well as by an often ignored bias present in low response rates.       This presentation will exemplify how the electronification of human       behavior supplies an added complete, reliable, and easily accessible       resource for analysis both through regular content statements (exemplified       by e-mails and blogs) as well as the electronic traces of behavior       (exemplified by click-streams of web behavior).

This presentation will       report on IASSIST's outreach efforts to the natural science community at       the CODATA conference, held in Beijing, China, in October 2006.nbsp; In a       keynote address at CODATA 2006, Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a professor of marine       biology and zoology at Oregon State University, challenged the scientific       community to make scientific knowledge more understandable, relevant, and       useful by improving communication between the scientific researcher and       the public at large.nbsp; The presenters, Paula Lackie and William Block,       responded to this clarion call by tailoring their CODATA presentation on       Social Science Data Archives to issues raised in Lubchenco's keynote       speech.nbsp; Our argument:nbsp; the social science data community       already fosters communication between (social) scientific research and the       public via the close interaction of social scientists, data professionals,       and computing specialists that make up the IASSIST community.nbsp; In       that regard, the social science data community--as exemplified by       IASSIST--was held up as a model to the natural science community for       achieving the objectives outlined in the CODATA keynote.",

They do this by       collecting, collating and compiling routine data for assessing the local       response to HIV/AIDS. Various open data storage and retrieval tools (CRIS,       EpiInfo) are available to assist in this vein. Although information may be       collected at all levels, lapses in standardisation of reporting formats       may lead to decision-making vacuums because some agencies have different       ME targets. nbsp;Although facing enormous challenges, the HIV/AIDS       ME experience in Ghana has been successful because community,       district, regional, national and global monitoring are linked to a common       goal set out in the national ME plan.",

The question database will       hold information on every question from the questionnaires deposited in       the archive. The database will be searchable from the Web via a dedicated       search interface. Having access to the full and original question wording       will improve data services in several ways. The paper will present the new       advantages and possibilities such as 1) Users will have an additional       method for identifying more precisely relevant surveys, links to all the       surveys using the given question, 2) the possibility of making comparative       research of the surveys using a given question, 3) support in the       construction of new questions and questionnaires-new research projects as       the question wordings themselves reflect the time and circumstances in       which they were designed-more open access and insight in the surveys and       the data via the question database.

In the past year the Qb has undergone extensive redesign to       improve its usefulness. This demonstration will have two key aims: firstly       to examine what the Qb is and how it may be used in conjunction with other       data resources, secondly to show how it may be used to examine different       questionnaire documentation styles and make comparisons between them. Two       particular issues arising from the facilities in CAPI programs (mainly       Blaise in the UK) will be discussed:nbsp; routing and control checks. The       variety of solutions to the problems of reporting these functions adopted       by survey agencies will be highlighted. This will be interpreted from the       viewpoint of the secondary analyst, making clear the need for DDI       standards in this area. ",

This distributed model       allows nodes to specialise in data where access may be blocked, but there       exists a critical mass of researchers who are able to open data, add value       and ensure sustainability. One such data type is that of Indigenous data.       The Indigenous population in Australia is small and highly disadvantaged.       Data collected by government are treated with the utmost sensitivity to       protect both the population and the government from criticism. But even       within those groups working to improve the conditions of Australia's       Indigenous population, there is a level of protectiveness and       restrictiveness which sees data blocked to those outside the immediate       network. This paper will investigate methods used in ASSDA's pilot project       to get stakeholder buy-in and establish an open source of Indigenous       data.",

Making       data open stimulates some important processes providing development of       knowledge communities in Russia. 1. It encourages horizontal links between       researchers. Russian scholars always suffer from lack of regular       interpersonal connections. Sharing of data breaks dissociation of Russian       scientific society and stimulates emerging of research networks. 2. It       increases quality of research. If one is to share collected data, s/he       aims to do the best to follow the high methodological standards. On the       other hand, analysis of trusted open data provides better base for further       development of research. 3. Provision of empirical materials for teaching       students in social and political science. Easily accessible trusted data       improve analytical skills of the students for their future as       scholars.",
