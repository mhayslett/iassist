Participants will work through a series of exercises using data in commonly encountered formats. Many of the exercises will involve reproducing tables and graphs from scratch. Topics to be covered include reading data, cleaning data, manipulating data, combining data, and using the help system. Attention will be paid to reproducibility of results, which means that participants will be writing scripts in a do-file. Detailed notes will be provided to each participant for reference. This workshop's target audience is social science librarians and other data service professionals. By the end of the workshop, participants should have gained enough familiarity with Stata to be able to start using it independently and to provide more in-depth help to their patrons who use Stata.This is not a workshop in statistical methods, hence no knowledge of statistics is assumed.

GeoBlacklight metadata is required to make the application work, and there are several ways to create records efficiently. Using a re-configured installation of Omeka, we will demonstrate how to capture, export, and store GeoBlacklight metadata. This tool can be leveraged to assist researchers in the submission of GIS data and the creation of geospatial metadata, and it can be used by librarians to generate records at the batch level as they develop collections.

At the core of this is the ability to compare and contrast modern events in a historical context, and this requires accurate data to be centrally managed and easily accessible.Currently, historical information on Australian Parliaments has been available in the Parliamentary Library's flagship publication the Parliamentary Handbook - an extensive almanac with biographies, tables and records dating back to Australia's federation. This data is used as a way to track key social issues, such as length of service, gender representation in parliament and historical election information in an authoritative format.To improve access to this information the library began development of a mobile app which evolved into a complete data management system for the recording and sharing of information. To complement this the Parliamentary Library is developing an open-source data management system for managing parliamentary biographies and service histories based on Popolo, a civic data framework for the management and dissemination of parliamentary information. Along with interactive biographies and records of ministries and parties, the system for the first time allows users to build custom tables from complex queries that are dynamically updated as new information is made available.Coupled with this is the development of a biographical data management system that will ensure that records of new parliamentarians and future changes to existing parliamentarians are captured in a single system.In this presentation, we cover the challenges and successes in digitising over 100 years parliamentary data, including migration, data cleansing and data trust issues. We also provide a technical breakdown of the chosen framework and infrastructure, and issues during development especially when dealing with imprecise or incomplete historical records.", "presenters": [{"name": "Samuel Spencer", "institution": "Parliamentary Libaray/Commonwealth of Australia"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7293", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7366", "nid": "7366", "postDate": "2017-03-03 12:56:09 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "Vintage Is Just a Cooler Word for Old: Salvaging the SSLS/SYPS", "abstract": "The first Scottish School Leavers survey (SSLS) was administered in 1962, and conducted usually biennially until 2005.

Is research data sharing to their advantage? To tackle this question, we built a model in which there is an explicit cost associated with sharing datasets whereas reusing such sets implies a benefit. In our calculations, conflicting interests appear for researchers. Individual researchers are always better off not sharing and omitting sharing costs, whereas at the same time both sharing and not sharing researchers are better off if (almost) all researchers share. Namely, the more researchers share, the more benefit can be gained by the reuse of those datasets. Further simulation results point out that, although policy measures should be able to increase the rate of sharing researchers, and increased discoverability and dataset quality could partly compensate for costs, a better measure would be to directly lower the cost for sharing, or even turn it into a (citation-) benefit. Making data available would in that case become the most profitable, and therefore stable, strategy.

A clear literature gap is the omission of analyzing individual researcher intrinsic motivation for data sharing.Social psychology offers the analytical framework that allows us to investigate how personal beliefs can shape intentions of individuals and how these intentions influence their behavior. Based on the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen and Fishbein, which emphasizes the impact of peer group, this paper sets out to explain data sharing behavior by authors in political science and sociology journals.A set of authors of publications from pre-selected ISI indexed journals have been surveyed.

This panel considers how libraries might strategically reconsider communications about data services.Researchers' debates over the merits of data sharing mention funder mandates only in passing, if at all. This suggests that librarians' focus on mandates for data sharing will connect with only a subset of researchers' data needs. First, Herndon and O'Reilly discuss this difference between librarians and researchers, then suggest different ways that libraries might frame data management services, and consider additional data services that libraries might offer.Next, Bennett and Nicholson consider the premise that \"bad information is processed more thoroughly than good\" and integrate that premise into an exploration of the alignment of library-emanating data management communications with the data-related expectations of researchers in different academic domains.

The Network enables researchers across the UK to gain access to linked de-identified administrative data to benefit society i.e. research that could change health care systems, improve the distribution of funds to needier areas or has the potential to reduce crime.To extend the Network's reach, the Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN) in addition to a breadth of communications and public engagement activities across the UK is developing a UK National Citizens Panel (CP).

The need for a consistent legal framework across Europe is one important reason why in January 2012 The European Commission proposed a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A regulation is (in contrast to the directive) a binding legislative act and must be applied in its entirety across the EU. The completion of this reform is expected by the end of 2015. The GDPR will have a direct impact on the framework conditions for research and the result of the ongoing reform process is therefore of great importance to the scientific communities of Europe.One central concern is whether the new regulation creates good, secure and predictable conditions for scientific research and research infrastructures. On the other hand, one of the aims to propose a new legal framework on data protection was to harmonize legal practices across Europe, and thus to ease transfer of personal data between countries. These aspects could be of great value for cross national research.This paper will discuss how the new legislations affect data collection, data use, data preservation and data sharing: How will the regulation influence the possibilities for processing personal data for research purposes? How are personal data defined? What conditions apply to an informed consent? In which cases is it legal and ethical to conduct research without the consent of the data subjects?

Thus, funding organizations, such as the German Research Foundation (DFG), the European Commissions or the National Science Foundation (NSF), requested data management plans within project proposals to ensure the adequate handling of publicly funded research data. In the context of collaborative, interdisciplinary research projects, proper data management and services should support for example accurate data storage, backup, and documentation. This facilitates data sharing within the project and re-use for future studies.In this contribution, we will present experiences gained from establishing RDM and related services for the DFG-funded interdisciplinary, long-term research project Collaborative Research Centre/Transregio 32 (CRC/TR32, www.tr32.de). Since 2007, CRC/TR32 scientists focus their work on patterns in soil, vegetation, and atmosphere. In this context the CRC/TR32 sub-project INF (\u02dcInformation infrastructure\u00e2 is responsible for the management of all relevant research data, collected or created by the scientists with the objective to enable systematic and long-term use of this project data. In this framework several RDM services were established. This includes the establishment of the project data repository TR32DB (www.tr32db.de) according to demands of the project participants and DFG. The TR32DB supports common features such as data storage, backup, documentation, search, exchange, provision and DOIs for selected datasets.

We successfully reached five courses within CLA, in the departments of statistics, journalism, communication, and writing studies. This presentation will discuss this effort, along with the surprisingly in-depth collaboration developed with a technical communication course in writing studies. It will also cover takeaways from this experience, such as the benefits of having both qualitative and quantitative viewpoints on a data management task, and how this experience will shape our approaches for providing future data management services to the humanities.", "presenters": [{"name": "Alicia Hofelich Mohr", "institution": "University of Minnesota"}, {"name": "Alice Motes", "institution": "University of Minnesota"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2016/2016_1i_mohr_etal.pdf", "name": "2016_1i_mohr_etal.pdf"}], "sessNid": "7302", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7394", "nid": "7394", "postDate": "2017-03-17 08:57:11 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "What Is Your 'Unit of Analysis' And, More Importantly, Why?

While students drawn to these courses are often math and statistics savvy and relatively adept at working with statistical programs, many still lack an understanding of data creation processes such as why the data were collected, how the populations delimited and sampled, and precisely how variables are defined and measured such that they might stand-in for phenomena. Moreover, the ease of acquiring these datasets can contribute to the abstraction, and more crucially the assumptions, inherent in translating the complexity of human experience into numerical values.Common approaches to teaching undergraduate social science students to find data include referring them to the secondary literature, pointing them to data repositories, and walking them through a 'unit of analysis'\u009d worksheet. We argue that while such worksheets may help a student define the parameters of the data they are after, they reinforce the same abstraction inherent in the data dilemma to begin with. We present a range of tools developed this year to support data discovery with the goal of reinforcing data literacy for undergraduate social science students while helping them find the resources they need. These tools include the data review and the determinant inventory. We describe how we adapted and integrated these tools into a revised data discovery worksheet emphasizing a more holistic conception of how data models real world phenomena.", "presenters": [{"name": "Parvaneh Abbaspour", "institution": "Lewis  Clark College"}, {"name": "E.

While data producers and researchers may produce automatically generated metadata as a by-product of their work - such as in statistical data files, questionnaires or project reports - any expectations of the manual creation of metadata (such as study metadata in DDI terms) have traditionally been relatively low. However, with the growth in the volume of both research data and content from other sources, the workload demands on archives can only be expected to grow. As such, there is a significant need to reduce the processing and metadata production workload within archives. One means for achieving this is to improve the quality of the automatically generated metadata that is created by producers.This paper reports on two recent projects occurring at the Australian Data Archive that aim to enable this improved production - by supporting minor developments in metadata production to earlier in the data lifecycle. ADA staff have been working with two data producers involved in significant national survey projects to implement minor changes to standards and practices within their data production process.

Determining how best to recognise continuities between metadata collections within the same study, including question continuity and methodological continuities has been a primary challenge. To answer it, the starting point was the creation of a questions database. As seen at the 2014 DDI workshop in Dagstuhl, the minimum requirements that a metadata system should meet before being able to import/export DDI-L are uniqueness of items, versioning and granularity.   To conceive such a database, we had to start by using simple tools. We first identified metadata in CSV files that include variable-level information. We then performed a semi-manual import from these files to the database using importing scripts. Once we removed automatically the redundancy, with a further stage of human control, we generated the structure of the DDI-L compliant xml file.

Aware of this matter, GESIS is committed to the continuous development of its data sharing services, aiming at different user groups, such as individual researchers, academic institutions or scientific journals. These groups place diverse demands on a data sharing tool, which have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, GESIS provides data sharing tools with functionalities adjusted to certain user groups. These are, for instance, individual researchers without an institutional affiliation or authors, who want to publish data sets they have used for the publication of their research results in academic journals.Additionally, GESIS, in collaboration with the Social Science Centre Berlin, the German Institute for Economic Research, and the German National Library of Economics started the development of SowiDataNet.

Publishing data in its own right is now recognised as being impactful to funders, yet exposing this narrative through \"showcasing\" is under exploited. Such narratives can incentivise others to share data and also improve the quality of the data and documentation.

It will detail the use of PhD interns to support the work of Information Services through engagement with the university research community in order help identify and describe data assets for ingest into both PURE and DataShare, and to validate and quality control metadata records for the purpose of being harvested by UKRDDS.", "presenters": [{"name": "Stuart Macdonald", "institution": "University of Edingburgh"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7307", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7437", "nid": "7437", "postDate": "2017-03-30 09:26:45 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "Modularizing Archive Services in the Social Sciences", "abstract": "Social science projects and public institutions produce increasing amounts of data to answer research questions. Although a growing number of these data sources are made available, some data producers are not looking for the \"classical\"\u009d full archival service, but only to particular services like long-term preservation (e.g. in institutional repositories). This development was foreseeable and poses challenges to the organizational structures of existing data service providers. To address these challenges, the Data Archive of GESIS, the Leibniz Institute for the Social Science, will modularize its service portfolio. We will move away from offering services as fixed \"bundles\"\u009d only (e.g. documentation, long-term preservation, registration, and distribution or onsite access for all) and aim instead at more accurately customized offers for depositors. By modularizing our services and introducing improved workflow management we hope to make archiving and data services more efficient and more beneficial for the scientific community. GESIS will deliver more timely services, research projects will see reduced costs in time and effort (e.g. in data preparation). Other specialized data services providers might profit from hearing of our experience. This presentation reviews the first phase of services restructuring.

It is often relegated to a citation or mentioned in an analysis, but it is rarely ever published with the results of the research it has informed. While making code and data available to scrutiny is a growing requirement for research funding, sharing code and raw data acknowledges the necessity for openness in research data management and scholarly communication.  Librarians are on the forefront of the open data movement, and are uniquely positioned to help researchers find tools and resources that make the work of research easier to do and to disseminate.  This presentation introduces iPython Notebook as a tool for sharing code-based research. iPython Notebook is an interactive web-based application that combines live code, data visualizations, and rich text and media. Using my own thesis work as an example, I will show how iPython notebooks can be used for text mining and data visualization on a 58-million-word, multi-file corpus. Using the coding language Python, I've conducted a text analysis on the transcripts of the Canadian Parliamentary debates (known as Hansard) to determine how the discourse of privacy has developed over a 10 year period. I've discovered changes over time in the patterns and frequencies of words being used in the discourse around privacy. I have shared my code and my corpus data on GitHub, for download and use by others.  iPython Notebooks not only provide a platform for code to be openly published, they allow other researchers to conduct their own investigations on the data. The structure of the notebooks makes them accessible to non-coders, and their multi-media format provides a linear space for explanation and analysis.  For research data to be truly open we must openly share and explain our code. iPython Notebook is an important tool that exemplifies the open data movement.", "presenters": [{"name": "Sandra Schwab", "institution": "University of Alberta"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7308", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7338", "nid": "7338", "postDate": "2017-02-06 13:35:04 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "Electronic lab notebooks: A solution for active-phase data management", "abstract": "Many universities are looking to enable researchers to store data effectively during the active phase of research.

For a scholar arriving at a conclusion using a statistical software package to analyze a quantitative dataset, making the claim transparent would include providing the dataset and software commands.  Research transparency is a much newer proposition for qualitative social science, especially where granular data are generated from individual sources, and the data are analyzed individually or in small groups. Because the data are not used holistically as a dataset, however, new ways have to be developed to associate the claims with the granular data and their analysis.  The Qualitative Data Repository has been working on annotation for transparent inference (ATI) for some time, and has made considerable progress, particularly in specifying what information needs to be surfaced for readers to be able to understand and evaluate published claims.

In order to maximize the value and utility of the released survey data, which can be reused as secondary data, derivative work inquiry service has been established to assist users to search citations based on archived datasets.   In present, three main ways are adopted by SRDA to collect the related publications, respectively internet, email survey on our users, and online report by SRDA members. The information of publications includes title, author, year of publish, and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the cited data. Hopefully, this inquiry service will help SRDA members for secondary data analysis. Consequently, this poster session will demonstrate current derivative work inquiry service from establishment, user interface, results of search, methodology, and future perspectives.", "presenters": [{"name": "Ya-Chi Lin", "institution": "Academia Sinica"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7315", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7479", "nid": "7479", "postDate": "2017-03-31 12:02:08 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "Keeping Track of Users and Publications at Social Science Japan Data Archive", "abstract": "This poster presents the background and workflow of user management at Social Science Japan Data Archive (SSJDA).  SSJDA keeps track of its users and publications since its start. The main motive is to ensure the trust from data producers when there was no data sharing institution in Japan. To convince data producers, we formulated a strict policy in terms of data use, and the subsequent report of publications. This procedure not only enhances the trust from data producers but also provides them incentive to deposit their data as they can actually see that they are acknowledged. It also helps SSJDA to demonstrate the impact of its activity quantitatively.  Initially, the management of users and publications was tedious paper work. We gradually developed the relational database between users, datasets, and publications. Further, the system was revised in such a way that users can submit their reports through the Internet and the submitted information is automatically updated within the database. Currently the collected information is used only within SSJDA, but we plan to set up a web page on which visitors can search and find the publications resulting from the secondary use of specific datasets.", "presenters": [{"name": "Yukio Maeda", "institution": "Social Science Japan Data Archive"}, {"name": "Satoshi Miwa", "institution": "Social Science Japan Data Archive"}, {"name": "Kenji Ishida", "institution": "Social Science Japan Data Archive"}, {"name": "Koichi Iriyama", "institution": "Social Science Japan Data Archive"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7315", "oldPath": "/conferences/2016/presentation/7480", "nid": "7480", "postDate": "2017-03-31 12:04:40 -0700"}, {"year": "2016", "title": "DDI implementation at the SSJDA", "abstract": "We will introduce DDI implementation at the Social Science Japan Data Archive (SSJDA), focusing on its two core projects.

For example, census data can be added to survey data.

Moreover, RDM cost depends on the specific design of a research project and so far very little data exists to help us identify cost drivers in a project.Our project aims to close the gap of missing reliable calculations by examining the cost of RDM as follows: Firstly, it identifies the areas of RDM causing costs in research projects. Secondly, it systematically analyzes RDM measures undertaken in different projects: (inter-)national surveys in which quantitative data was processed, harmonized and documented, as well as projects that collected qualitative data.

Reviewing data management plans (DMP's) from several countries, we asked the following questions: a) is there such thing as a DMP, or is there rather a variety of DMPs serving different goals? b) How useful/relevant are DMP's for researchers? c) How could DMP's be improved? Results of our analyses show that data management plans are often heavily focused on post-project data sharing with less concern for data management during the projects themselves.

Trust is a useful concept to apply in order to understand data reusers' thoughts, experiences, and needs, as the concept of trust is woven into the life cycle of data from the creation, preparation, and management of data to sharing, reuse and preservation and into the relations with parties involved in this life cycle.Assessing data for its trustworthiness becomes important for data reusers with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and the potential harm from using poor-quality data. Despite the importance of data reusers' trust in data, trust judgment is not a simple task for data reusers and the process of judging trust involves various social, individual, and institutional factors. Exploring many facets of data reusers' trust in data generated by other researchers and reuser-defined trust attributes will provide insights on how to improve current data curation activities in a user-trusted way, such as methods that ensure users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trustworthiness during data curation and developing user evaluation criteria for the trustworthiness of data.This study identifies a total of 11 trust attributes from among qualitative interview studies with 38 quantitative social science data reusers in the United States, which reflect current practices of data reuse and suggest various implications for data curation.

The importance of RDM is increasingly recognized from several organizations and institutions around the world, as it plays a crucial role in the documentation, curation and preservation of research data. Therefore, it is natural that libraries can be considered as a critical stakeholder in the RDM landscape. Their role is highly related to the following: RDM policy development, advocacy and awareness, patrons training, advisory services, data repository development etc.The paper will first present a brief overview of RDM and a detailed literature review regarding the RDM aspects adopted in libraries globally. It will also describe several tendencies concerning the management of repository tools for research data, as well as the challenges in implementing the RDM. The proper planned training and skill development for all stakeholders by mentors to train both staff and users are some of the issues that need to be considered to enhance the RDM process.

Hence, these institutions have need to publish/deliver trusted, high quality microdata primarily aimed at either scientific use or public use. These outputs have to be as detailed as possible, primarily if they are meant for scientific use, to meet the the objective of providing rich statistical information. However, this objective conflicts with the obligation the institutions have to protect the confidentiality of the information collected as part of surveys and/or other administrative activities.   Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) seeks to protect statistical data in such a way that they can be released without giving away confidential information that can be linked to specific individuals or entities.  Even though there is enough information and guidelines on performing SDC there is a lack of tools to enable one to perform SDC in an effective way. Most institutions perform anonymization of the data they deliver manually. This manual anonymisation process is often quite challenging, cumbersome and time consuming needing high level of expertise and often with no repeatability or traceability.  This talk will present SDCMicroGUI - a tool for Statistical Disclosure Control. The free-GPL licensed R-based sdcMicroGUI tool allows users to perform common anonymization methods along with supporting estimation of disclosure risks and calculating of data utility post anonymisation on micro-datasets through easy-to-use, highly interactive, menu-based operations.

Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) ethics compliance professionals have a different view on data management. Data management perspectives come from data usability and re-usability. The RCR perspective draws from government ethics regulations such as human subjects/IRB guidelines and other ethical protocols. Even though views of data ethics inform lifecycle data management, when the two points of view get to details they have very different perspectives.This presentation will share what happens when scholarly communications and RCRnbsp; professionals realize they have these very different ideas of what data management means. If you come to this session, you\u2019ll learn how we harmonized the two views to build a local partnership around our common language of ethics and data. The shared understanding we built underpins our shared \"ethical management of data\" workshop. The harmonized workshop lets us have double the reach as we co-teach to audiences whether they are interested in ethics or data.", "presenters": [{"name": "Nina Exner", "institution": "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "7624", "oldPath": "/conferences/2017/presentation/7675", "nid": "7675", "postDate": "2018-03-16 09:23:37 -0700"}]}, {"year": "2017", "day": "2017-05-24", "title": "C4: Standards Based DDI Tools", "abstract": "", "chair": "Sam Spencer", "moderator": "", "sessionType": "Papers", "sessionTile": "", "webcastLink": "", "weight": "10", "hostNid": "7292", "oldPath": "/conferences/2017/session/7625", "nid": "7625", "postDate": "2018-03-16 06:41:02 -0700", "presentations": [{"year": "2017", "title": "No tools, No standard.

It influences how people communicate, how they gather information and how they behave \u2013 not only on social media platforms but in general.For example, WeChat is used by 700 million people in China. Additional services such as payment systems, language training etc. are incorporated into this app, resulting in a huge source of personal information. It is likely that such repositories will be one future of data collections.Research in the social sciences must be enabled to analyse social media data to understand how societies in general are changing and developing. This personal data should not only be used by commercial companies. The social sciences therefore need to build methods and infrastructures to access social media data sources and to support analyses. For several reasons (e.g. privacy concerns, proprietary data) existing secure data solutions seem to be particularly interesting to facilitate social media data access and sharing. Secure access solutions would also ensure proper documentation and quality of the data and the reproducibility of results. The talk will present first approaches to adapt and develop the Secure Data Center at GESIS also as a platform for social media data analysis.", "presenters": [{"name": "David Schiller", "institution": "GESIS"}, {"name": "Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda", "institution": "GESIS"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2017/h3schiller.pdf", "name": "h3schiller.pdf"}], "sessNid": "7647", "oldPath": "/conferences/2017/presentation/7731", "nid": "7731", "postDate": "2018-03-21 13:41:05 -0700"}]}]}
