In part this is because most scholars who use  quantitative data and analytical techniques have long accepted the norm,  even if they have not regularly complied with it. Standards for making  quantitative data accessible are widely acknowledged, and substantial  infrastructure for that sharing has been in place for many years.nbsp;  The idea  that qualitative data should be shared is much more recent and  controversial. Part of the debate arises from the absence of widely  shared understandings of the concrete operational practices for sharing  qualitative data. Of course, many of the best practices for dealing with  data that librarians, archivists, data center staff and other  information professionals typically employ remain applicable. However,  qualitative data present a variety of additional challenges due to their  close proximity to the social world from which they were drawn. Their  often-textual nature likewise poses special challenges to sharing,  particularly internationally. The workshop highlights these challenges  and provides a basic framework research data professionals can make use  of when called upon to advise their user community about managing  qualitative data.  Workshop  organizers are associated with the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR).  Funded by the National Science Foundation, QDR was established in 2014  to provide the infrastructure to safely store and share qualitative data  and to contribute to developing the expertise and tools needed to share  such data.nbsp;  Specific techniques, tools, and resources will be presented on the following topics:  Planning to manage qualitative data before a research project beginsOrganizing qualitative data for analysis and writing, research transparency and potential sharingSharing qualitative data ethically and legally and in a way that facilitates broad international accessThe uses to which shared qualitative data can be put", "presenters": [{"name": "Colin Elman", "institution": "Qualitative Data Repository"}, {"name": "Dessislava Kirilova", "institution": "Qualitative Data Repository"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "6905", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/6982", "nid": "6982", "postDate": "2016-03-15 13:16:00 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "New data from IPUMS-CPS, ATUS-X, and IPUMS-SESTAT", "abstract": "The IPUMS-CPS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series \u2013Current Population Survey), ATUS-X (American Time Use Survey Extract System), and IPUMS-SESTAT are microdata dissemination projects of the Minnesota Population Center (MPC).

This leads to many challenges, among them, discerning when a problem of access requires a technological, methodological, or cultural solution. Working across disciplinary boundaries also opens up new possibilities for engaging with data, by uncovering new uses for familiar data and by introducing new approaches of appreciating and critiquing our understanding of data and how we put it to use.nbsp; The presenters on this multidisciplinary panel will speak from their experiences in this fertile zone where data science meets the arts and humanities. A digital humanities librarian, a special collections librarian, a visualization librarian, and a curator of library exhibitions will each talk about their experiences reaching across disciplinary practices to get at and connect with data. Their case studies will shed light on common questions and experiences regarding working with new partners, managing expectations around such work, and helping patrons find data in places they may have never thought to look before.Heather TompkinsDigital humanities often results in the production ofnbsp; rich collections of digital objects, metadata, and data, but digital humanists may not always see this digital output as data. This space between digital humanities and data services creates an occasion for librarians in expanding conceptions of data on campus to include materials beyond quantitative information.nbsp; This work takes on additional pedagogical significance when mentoring and teaching undergraduate research assistants who will support faculty projects.nbsp; This presentation explores one approach for exploring this intersections betweennbsp; digital humanities and data services and raises questions about what DH can borrow from the tradition of data services in this area. David PavelichFor decades, archives and special collections libraries have been collecting data in diverse formats, sometimes purposely, sometimes incidentally. The content is equally, endlessly diverse, from diary reckonings of the value of slaves; to 19th century weather data; to unpublished financial data collected by twentieth century economists. Many such archival items (like ledgers) are passed over by researchers because of their complexities or inscrutability. However, these collections of under-explored data hold pedagogical potential for undergraduate (and even graduate) instruction. This paper offers a way for special collections librarians and data librarians to work together to teach students about using primary sources from two very different perspectives within the research library.Margaret Pezalla-GranlundMany artists are interested in the way information is represented, and explore techniques of visualizing data through their artwork. Some of the most interesting artwork about data gets to questions about how we read data, how it is understood (and misunderstood), and the possibility of uncertainty. Is there an art behind data? Can a graph be expressive? What can artists tell us about how we look at numbers? For this session, I will choose three key artist\u2019s books to use as case studies to explore the ways in which artists visualize and interpret data.Justin JoqueFrom text mining projects to the creation of interactive websites, humanists are turning towards data as a way to understand and augment their research. Offering data visualization and mapping support as part of our Spatial and Numeric Data Services, we often assist on substantial portions of these projects. Especially as various sources and types of textual data, including those with interesting topological features such as link networks for websites, become available and methodologies for processing large corpora develop, humanists are increasingly using and thinking critically about data. The vast amounts of data that can be computationally processed are pushing the boundaries of what reading and analyzing textual information means in the humanities.

Research Data Canada (RDC) is a collaborative, non-government organization interested in access to and preservation of Canadian research data. The RDC Standards and Interoperability Committee (RDC-SINC) assessed 30 Canadian and International research data repositories for data transfer, storage, curation, preservation, and access.

However, ReShare's metadata profile and discovery system is fully integrated in UKDS. We optimise linkages with other systems to maximise standardisation, and minimise the 'burden' on depositors of completing a metadata record. Once depositors complete their project record, ReShare administrators conduct reviews to check for disclosure risks, and quality of documentation. Currently, there are 595 collections in ReShare, 500 of which were migrated from the ESRC Data Store, which ReShare replaced. To incentivise and reward depositors who provide complete well-constructed project records containing data and robust supporting documentation, we are introducing a quality mark on projects which meet the criteria.nbsp; This paper discusses the criteria for this quality mark in more depth, reflects upon the common issues faced in the review process of ReShare, and provides recommendations on how depositors can avoid making the common errors seen in ReShare.

The overarching - and so far in Germany unique - objective is the construction of an infrastructure for decentralized research data from the social and economic sciences in Germany. At present, the holding of research data in Germany is heavily fragmented, which precludes a user-friendly, centralized and therefore quick data retrieval. Due to this major hurdle, data reuse by other scholars underlies extremely high levels of complexity and effort, or in the worst - but not very uncommon - case is simply impossible. This dissatisfying situation is aimed to be resolved by SowiDataNet, which will integrate decentralized research data together within one repository-network. The core of this network will be a web-based, independent infrastructure that allows for low-threshold self-archiving, standardized documentation and distribution of research data.

This is borne out of a need to be transparent, inclusive and trusted. One of our challenges to reduce the public's data trust deficit is to balance the communications messages so as not to increase fear by increasing awareness. This is an exercise in risk management, as without widespread communications targeted at all levels of society the benefits may not be realised.

For this kind of research data of different types and from multiple sources are needed. A future challenge for the European Research Community and related institutions is to build a research Infrastructure that will be able to integrate data in different forms and from multiple sources such as Data Archives, Research Data Centres, National Statistical Institutes, the corporate sector or the Internet.

This will improve the European Research infrastructure and allow researchers to make use of relational information and data.

We have developed an analytic rubric for assessing DMPs. An analysis of DMPs can identify common gaps in researcher understanding of RDM principles and practices, and identify barriers for researchers in applying best practices. Our rubric allows librarians to utilize DMPs as a research tool that can inform decisions about which research data services they should provide. This tool enables librarians who may have no direct experience in applied research or RDM to become better informed about researchers' data practices and how library services can support them.

Thereby different benefits, depending on the regarding implementation, of such solutions are highlighted. Finally possible developments will be discussed. The presented systems are: The job submission system of the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) that provides access to highly detailed labour market data. RAIRD, a web-based system for confidential research on full population event data from a set of Norwegian administrative registers. The RAIRD platform supports on-the-fly import (and conversion) of event data into a disclosure-limiting web based statistical package for remote data processing and analysis. The Real Time Remote Access program at Statistics Canada which uses technology to enable fast, on-\u0090line access to detailed microdata for researchers through a balance of controlling the risk of disclosure (automation of confidentiality rules) and managing the risk of disclosure (contracts with individuals and institutions). DataSHIELD a novel solution that allows for an analyst to perform pooled analyses of data held at different locations without ever seeing the microdata or transferring them to his computer (i.e. the data remain at their original location under the control of the data owner).", "presenters": [{"name": "Donna Dosman", "institution": "Statistics Canada"}, {"name": "David Price", "institution": "Statistics Canada"}, {"name": "Atle Alvheim", "institution": "Norwegian Social Science Data Services"}, {"name": "Ornulf Risnes", "institution": "Norwegian Social Science Data Services"}, {"name": "Amadou Gaye", "institution": "University of Bristol"}, {"name": "Vincent Ferretti", "institution": "Ontario Institute of Cancer Research"}], "files": [], "sessNid": "6943", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7141", "nid": "7141", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:09:53 -0700"}]}, {"year": "2015", "day": "2015-06-05", "title": "G5: Dataverse: A repository framework for all", "abstract": "", "chair": "Sonia Barbosa", "moderator": "", "sessionType": "Panel", "sessionTile": "", "webcastLink": "", "weight": "11", "hostNid": "6841", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/session/6944", "nid": "6944", "postDate": "2016-02-24 14:45:35 -0700", "presentations": [{"year": "2015", "title": "Odum Institute Archives services overview", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Jonathan Crabtree", "institution": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Odum Institute for Research in Social Science"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_crabtree.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_crabtree.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7142", "nid": "7142", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:13:52 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "Linking journals and repositories using OJS and Dataverse", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Alex Garnett", "institution": "Simon Fraser University"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_garnett.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_garnett.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7143", "nid": "7143", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:15:35 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "Dataverse at the University of Alberta", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Charles (Chuck) Humphrey", "institution": "University of Alberta"}, {"name": "Larry Laliberte", "institution": "University of Alberta"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_humphrey.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_humphrey.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7144", "nid": "7144", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:17:45 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "Dataverse at Scholars Portal", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Amber Leahy", "institution": "Scholars Portal"}, {"name": "Leanne Trimble", "institution": "Scholars Portal"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_leahey.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_leahey.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7145", "nid": "7145", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:19:18 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "UX for Dataverse", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Elizabeth Quigley", "institution": "Harvard University"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_quigley.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_quigley.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7146", "nid": "7146", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:20:58 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "Dataverse in China: internationalization, curation and promotion", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Yin Shenqin", "institution": "Fudan University, China"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_shenquin.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_shenquin.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7147", "nid": "7147", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:23:50 -0700"}, {"year": "2015", "title": "DataverseNL Dataverse network in the Netherlands", "abstract": "", "presenters": [{"name": "Marion Wittenberg", "institution": "Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)"}], "files": [{"url": "https://iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/../../../downloads/2015/2015_g5_wittenberg.pdf", "name": "2015_g5_wittenberg.pdf"}], "sessNid": "6944", "oldPath": "/conferences/2015/presentation/7148", "nid": "7148", "postDate": "2016-04-29 07:25:19 -0700"}]}]}
