The  Minnesota Population Center (MPC) is one of the world's leading  developers of demographic data resources. In this workshop, attendees  will learn about the content of the MPC data resources and receive basic  information about how to get and use the data, which are available free  over the internet. The first part of this workshop will focus on the  IPUMS projects, which include census and survey microdata data from over  80 countries.  Attendees will download the data over the internet and  analyze in a statistical package, and use the online analysis system to  perform analyses without a statistical package.   The second part of  this workshop will focus on the NHGIS, which provides aggregate census  data from 1790-present. Attendees will learn how the data are  constructed, how to obtain the data, and then they will graph it using  GIS.",

                    "abstract": "We  know that government agencies collect a huge amount of information  about individuals, companies and organisations.  Many of us know the  potential of unlocking these data for helping us to understand the world  in which we live - but too often, access to these sources are denied by  the data owners. Security and confidentiality are the main reasons  cited.Both  NORC and the UK Data Archive's Secure Data Service have pioneered  secure access to sensitive sources of data, allowing academic  researchers to undertake innovative analyses that better inform public  policy.This  workshop will focus on how to set up a secure data enclave (a remote  access method that allows researchers to access sensitive data, without  the data leaving a secure home), based on the experiences of NORC and  SDS which are recent success stories.  The following areas will be  covered in the workshop:                                              1. Re-visiting the data access spectrum: why do we need a secure enclave?                         2. Technologies                         3. Security - standards, maintenance, auditing                         4. Convincing data owners to provide the data                         5. Staffing a secure enclave                         6. Working with researchers to ensure safe access                         7. Establishing a community of safe researchers                         8.

                    "abstract": "The UK's Digital Curation Centre has recently developed DMPOnline, a  web-based service that guides researchers through the process of writing  a structured and standardised data management plan, mapped to a wide  range of major research funding agencies. Our project seeks to augment  the DMPOnline tool with an information risk management tool that would  assist data managers in the development and maintenance of formal  Information Security Management Systems in line with the ISO-27001:2005  international standard for information security. Since the DMPOnline is  currently a simple checklist of questions we aim to refine this model.  This project will assess the viability of creating an extensible  architecture for data management planning through the use of DDI (an  established metadata standard) and related tooling. A pre-existing open  source DDI 3.1 registry and editors will be extended, allowing for the  creation of semantically rich project-specific representations of data  management plans through a DDI broker, providing the basis of  interoperability with a set of data management services. We hope to  demonstrate the value of data management planning in the provision and  maintainance of effective information security.",

DataONE will make biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; make environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; and engage scientists, land-managers, policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualizations. The DataONE Usability and Assessment Working Group is tasked with conducting a variety of assessments on aspects of the DataONE project. This presentation will discuss the results of a survey sent to data managers to assess current data management and data sharing needs, practices, and attitudes. IASSIST members were invited to participate in the survey via the listserv. Questions asked included how much data is deposited on public, internal, or personal websites, access/use conditions, the reasons data managers do not make their data available to others electronically, policies and processes for data deposition and storage, use of metadata to describe data and the metadata standards and tools used, training on best practices and adequate funding for data management, and data management plans, among other things.",

The DMVitals  is a tool to assess data management practices based on a series of best  practices statements. With the DMVitals a data management consultant  associates a list of data management practices to portions of the  research data interview and rank reserachers' current practices base to  their level of data \u201csustainability\u201d. The DMVitals tool generates  customized and actionable recommendations to help researchers improve  their data management practices. The tool also creates objective,  repeatable recommendations that can be generated rapidly. This paper  will detail the development of the DMVitals tool and describe how UVa  SciDaC integrates it into their existing data interview and data  management plan process to expedite the data management recommendation  report process and to provide actionable feedback which researchers can  use almost immediately to improve the sustainability of their data. The  paper will also illustrate how the DMVitals can easily be integrated in  other data management assessment tools such as the Digital Curatin  Center's (DCC) CARDIO.",

There are increasing  amount of descriptive studies on the current data needs of different  discipline, there are also best practices of data management developed  with the mindset of taking care of data during its whole life cycle. But  among all these hot discussions of the opportunities and challenges  that data is bringing to the world, there haven't been enough  philosophical thoughts or reflections on data's advantages and  limitations under the consideration of the different goals of science,  social sciences, and humanities' inquiries. This paper will start from  J\u00fcrgen Habermas' epistemology of knowledge and human interests; then  examine different e-research fields and their data usage trends with new  theoretical lens of their ultimate missions, that is how well they have  helped human beings instrumentally control the world, ideally change  the society, and easily understand each other across temporal and  spatial dimensions. We could then also have a higher level of vision  about what might be possible in the future that data could help each  research fields to accomplish.",

One oft-proposed  means for encouraging data sharing is for academic journals for academic  journals to encourage or require authors to make data publicly  available as part of the publication process. But to what extent have  journals heeded the call for replication policies? This presentation  will re-visit prior work, presented at IASSIST 2009, that compared  journals in Economics, Political Science, and Sociology in terms of  presence or absence of policies requiring authors to make data available  for replication purposes. Using updated data on a larger sample of  journals, we will examine both the extent to which journals are adopting  replication policies and whether such adoption varies across  disciplines.",

                    "abstract": "Studies of the citation networks of scientific papers show that science  is slowly but surely becoming more interdisciplinary: publications  increasingly incorporate ideas from disciplines outside of the primary  authors', and authors from different disciplines more frequently  collaborate and co-author papers. Few, if any, studies, however, have  distinguished between interdisciplinary collaboration or knowledge  sharing and interdisciplinary data reuse. Given the significant barriers  to data sharing and reuse that can arise even within a given  discipline, it is possible that patterns of interdisciplinary data reuse  differ somewhat from those of other kinds of interdisciplinarity. This  paper examines patterns of interdisciplinary data reuse in the social  sciences through a network analysis of data citation information from  ICPSR. The results will offer insight for data producers and data  managers in curating data to foster interdisciplinary reuse.",

The extent of dataset reuse as a mechanism to understand long-term usefulness within and beyond formal channels of scholarly communication, is an area where further investigation is needed particularly in relation to domain-based and subdiscipline differences. Based on the use metric categories and publication types presented by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) for the dissemination of social science-themed datasets, this study presents a parallel analysis of the distribution of traditional and non-traditional publications affiliated with publicly available datasets in the atmospheric sciences. These affiliated publications are works identified by the dataset creator related to a dataset and includes a variety of items such as peer-reviewed journal articles, technical reports, and theses. Preliminary results reveal the potential audiences and communities that dataset contributors reach through selection of publication type and quantity. As the boundaries of scholarly communication are continually pushed by the visibility and intellectual power of scientific datasets, a clearer understanding of their lasting value and extensive influence takes shape.",

The tools needed are mostly known and  available to the research community, starting with statistical packages  such as SPSS; the editing platform provided by NESSTAR complemented with  the open-source Microdata management toolkit by the IHSN; and combined  with the functionalities of spreadsheet applications such as Excel --  everything needed to publish data, even XML handling, is provided. Our  presentation aims to show that high quality standards are not in  contradiction with modest resources. Once the needs of the researchers  are well understood, a little tweaking of existing tools allows huge  improvements to visual efficiency and user-friendliness. As the skills  needed lay far below the level of trained IT specialists, there is no  absolute need to wait for the industry to come up with new software;  competent and creative social scientists with more modest aims is all it  takes.",

While useful for processing and analytical  purposes, it makes it challenging to access unless you have the right  software or utility, which often requires commercial licensing. While  statistical packages are not particularly metadata aware, these files  hold a significant amount of variable level information. Having the  ability to extract these in a DDI friendly XML format along with  complementing it with summary statistics computed off the data, is  highly desirable. Extending on previous efforts, Metadata Technology  North America has enhanced and developed new Java based packages for  reading Stata and SPSS files that can export the data in ASCII text  format and extract variable level DDI-Codebook and DDI-Lifecycle  metadata (data dictionary and summary statistics). Various options are  available in terms of ASCII flavors and metadata generation, providing  features beyond what is typical export capabilities of statistical  packages or utilities. This enables the conversion of data files into  open format combining ASCII+DDI, fit for long term preservation,  dissemination, or further processing by DDI aware tools. Our  presentation will provide an overview of these utilities, describe use  cases, share lessons learned, and discuss future development.",

XML Schemas express the vocabulary and the syntactic structure of XML  documents representing both DDI data and meta-data. There is a huge  amount of XML document instances, which has to be mapped to the RDF  representation of the developed DDI domain ontology, in order to reuse  already existing DDI data and meta-data and to profit from the benefits  associated with the RDF format. A manual mapping, however, requires a  lot of time, is very error-prone, and therefore not applicable. The  authors devised a generic approach which converts unexceptionally any  XML Schemas to generated ontologies automatically using XSLT  transformations. Domain ontologies, such as an ontology of the DDI, can  be derived automatically on the basis of the generated ontologies using  SWRL rules. As a consequence, all the information, located in the  underlying XML Schemas and associated XML documents, is also expressed  in the DDI ontology and its RDF representation. Subsequently, ontology  engineers will add supplementary domain-specific semantic information,  not represented in the XML Schemas, to the DDI ontology.",

                    "abstract": "The Data Catalogue contains the study descriptions for all archived  studies at GESIS. These descriptions include information about primary  researchers, research topics and objects, used methods and the resulting  dataset. They are primarily used for archiving and retrieval. However,  for this purpose the existing metadata can be enriched with further  information about the study content, investigators, involved  affiliations, collection dates, and more from other sources like e.g.  DBpedia, GeoNames or the Name Authority File (PND) of the German  National Library. In this paper we present how to enrich a study  description with datasets from the LOD cloud. To accomplish this, we  expose selected elements of the study description in RDF (Resource  Description Framework) by applying commonly used vocabularies. This  optimizes the interoperability to other RDF datasets and hence the  possibility to express links between them. For link detection we use  existing algorithms and tools, which are most promising in discovering  relevant links to related data. Once links are detected, the study  description is linked to external datasets and holds therefore  additional information for the user, e.g. occurred events before or  during the collection dates of a study, which are relevant to its topic.",

Linked data makes use of existing web technologies  standardized by the W3C such as HTTP and URIs and extends them to enable  the machine actionability of web information. The DDI 3 has a very  robust information model containing many relationships between metadata  items. This can be seen through the DDI 3's use of references to enable  reuse. This DDI model can also be represented in RDF. This paper  examines why serializing DDI as RDF can be beneficial, how DDI 3 can be  represented in RDF, stored in a repository, and queried using the  standard SPARQL query language. An example of these concepts is  demonstrated using Colectica RDF Services.",

                    "abstract": "Preserving digital data is a challenge. For the outcome to be  successful, many organisational and practical issues need to be in  place. The Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD,  http://www.fsd.uta.fi/) is dedicated to support the life cycle of  digital research data in social sciences. It is therefore critical that  FSD's operations and procedures are up-to-date and consistent with  relevant standards and best practices. The key standard for long term  preservation of digital data is the Open Archival Information System  (OAIS) Reference Model (ISO14721:2003). This presentation will explore  FSD's conformance to OAIS and describe how FSD's functions map to the  seven OAIS functions (ingest, archival storage, data management,  administration, preservation planning, access and common services), with  special attention to ingest and access. We will also discuss the  process and results of a self-assessment that was conducted analysing  FSD policies, plans and procedures within the framework of the Audit and  Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDR) Checklist  (CCSDS 652.0-M-1). We will summarise the weaknesses, risks and strengths  identified, discuss the use of the TDR metrics and analyse how adopting  standards and best practices could facilitate co-operation and  collaborative partnerships.",

Whether an archive is worthy  of such trust is a question that needs to be answered so that data  producers will know where to submit their data for safekeeping and  continuing dissemination to current and future communities of interest. A  new standard released by the International Organization for  Standardization, ISO 16363, specifies the requirements for certification  of a digital repository as trustworthy. With the establishment of the  new standard, archives have measurable targets for attaining  trustworthiness\u2014and users of archives, including depositors, have a way  to determine if a particular archive meets their need for a trustworthy  archive. An initial set of test audits using the new standard offers  insight into the audit process and the level and type of effort required  for archives to become certified as trustworthy. The authors will  describe the test audit of an interdisciplinary scientific data center  for compliance with the draft standard and summarize the test results.",

The Data Seal of Approval and it's quality  guidelines may be of interest to research institutions, organizations  that archive data and to users of that data. It can be granted to any  repository that applies for it via the assessment procedure. Achieving  the DSA means that the data concerned have been subjected to the sixteen  guidelines of which the assessment procedure consists. The data archive  as an organization should take care of the overall implementation of  the DSA in its own specific field. In the integrated Framework for  Auditing and certification, which is being set up at the moment, DSA  will be the first step in 3 tiered certification process, see:  http://www.trusteddigitalrepository.eu The DSA-Board has developed an  online self-assessment tool through which the DSA can be applied for. In  this paper we will present the online application tool, focussing  amongst others on problems and solutions, as well as elaborate on the  procedures around DSA.",

                    "abstract": "The project infinitE aims at improving the access to micro data in  Germany. At present, researchers have the possibility to gain access to  micro data via remote execution. By doing so, the researcher is provided  with a so-called \"data structure file\" that enables him to develop a  code that is applied to the statistical software of the researchers  choice by the staff of the Research Data Centers. Afterwards, the output  is manually checked for confidentiality and is handed over to the  researcher. Unfortunately, this imposes a substantial waiting period on  the researcher. In addition, the process of manual output checking  demands a lot of manpower in the Research Data Centers. That is why in  the course of infinitE the foundation for an automatization both of the  process of starting the code of the researcher and the output checking  was laid. This comes along with the need of the application of new  methods of output checking instead of the cell suppression method  currently used in the Research Data Centers. The outcomes of infinitE  have demonstrated that a partial automatization, or even a full  automatization of the German micro data acceess is not a question of  feasibility, but of costs.",

These examples include  triumphs, whimpers, and lots in between. The initial impetus to embrace  varied communication tools was to liven things up: in workshops -  especially workshops crammed with too much material in too little time;  selected techniques were also helpful in an 8:30am required quantitative  reasoning class. But, over time, I've embraced technology as a way to  enhance communication even when the audience is eager and engaged. In  ten years, the technology and tools will be different, but the need for  data professionals (and others) to reach their audiences will remain.  So, the major issue is really the message, not the medium. But, it is  important to learn, evaluate, and embrace new communication  technologies. Alas a technique I haven't ever used is the Pecha Kucha.  It is time for one more tool for audience engagement.",

This presentation will describe the approach  taken to address this concern by ESDS International, a specialist  service of the Economic and Social Data Service who disseminate and  support aggregate and survey international datasets for the UK academic  community. Key issues citing ESDS International hosted datasets, such as  the OECD's Main Economic Indicators will be highlighted, including:  revisions to historical series, frequently updated datasets, multiple  publishers, data access restrictions and granualarity of the citation.  We will explain how we worked with DataCite UK to create bibliographic  citations conforming to the DataCite Metadata Schema  (http://dx.doi.org/10.5438/0005) and used their Metadata Store to mint  Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). In addition we will illustrate how we  have integrated citation information into our data delivery software.  Finally we will describe future challenges - primarily user adoption and  publisher buy-in.",

This however requires combining domain  expertise, infrastructures, tools, and technologies, an endeavor that  can be challenging even for larger organizations. Metadata Technology  North America and Integrated Data Management Services are at the  forefront of such efforts. As such, we recognize the need for providing  free or low-costs access to shared infrastructure and tools for  fostering metadata-driven data management and sharing. OpenMetadata is  our attempt at achieving such objective.The web based portal, to be  unveiled at IASSIST 2012, aims to provide agencies and users with an  online space for sharing metadata and gaining access to useful  tools/utilities around the DDI, SDMX and related standards. Furthermore,  it will provide detailed provenance information, directing users to  sources of data to apply for access and/or leverage other services. The  presentation will provide an overview of the initial set of tools and  services available through the portal, including OpenDDI, and outline  our long term vision.",

From a large number of collected use cases, it was  determined that a very general model would be needed. While not yet in  final form, this model borrows from several existing sources such as  QuDEX and TEI, and aims to support the description of CAQDAS-documented  multi-media data, text analysis, and more traditional interviews, texts,  video, audio, and image collections. It will support collections and  sub-collections, annotations and coding at the level of the files, and  also within files of different types. Further, it will provide a rich  toolset for linking between and among qualitative and quantitative data  objects. The end result of this work will serve as the basis for the  enhancement of DDI - Lifecycle in a future release.",

We consider how data infrastructure can support election studies to  ensure the data they produce is good quality reusable comparative data.  Election studies are critical large-scale data investments. When fully  realised, election studies provide an unparalleled spatial and temporal  resource for studying social attitudes and political behaviour. They  have contemporary value for researchers but also as long-term data  investments with prospective comparison across time and in comparative  cross-national analyses. However, election studies operate under  circumstances exceptional to other long-term longitudinal or repeated  cross-sectional studies. Elections may occur at irregular intervals or  as sudden \u2018snap' elections. Consequently, studies may have a  concentrated period to design and collect data. Here the risk is that  data management concerns are relegated to irrelevant or secondary  consideration under the pressure to produce publications, with the  result that data is not comparable across either time or spatial units.  We seek to ensure election studies produce well-documented data,  collected in compliance to recognised data harmonisation standards by  ensuring data management planning and metadata are incorporated and  implemented in the design and execution of the research.",

We examine costs and benefits as they relate to threats,  exploits, vulnerabilities, defence measures, incidents, and recovery  and restoration. We discuss privacy concerns and the implications of  implementing employee surveillance technologies and we suggest a  framework of fair practices which can be used for bridging the gap  between the need to provide adequate protection for information systems,  while preserving employees' rights to privacy. Organizations have to  prioritize the security of their computer systems in order to ensure  that their information assets retain their accuracy, confidentiality,  and availability. While the importance of the information security  policy in ensuring the security of information is acknowledged widely,  there has been little empirical analysis of its impact or effectiveness  in this role.",

Their results are published in  professional journals, usually without the underlying data. Data should  no longer be exclusively part of a scientific publication. This is why  the GESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences and the ZBW -  Leibniz Information Centre for Economics decided to implement the DOI  registration portal for German social and economic data - da|ra. The  datasets receive unique DOIs as citable identifiers and all relevant  metadata information. Persistent identifiers together with their  bibliographical information provide the opportunity to find and to cite  primary data in scientific publications. The data is clearly quotable  about the DOI. Pre-condition for the citation of data is the creation of  qualitative metadata. The da|ra metadata schema consists of mandatory  and optional fields. It is compliant with other important metadata  standards to ensure metadata interoperability. This presentation will  deal with the different steps need to be done for the data publishing  process and focus on how new features are included in the already  existing DOI service. It will show that using the services enables  scientists comfortably to discover, find and access scientific data.",

Although drawing upon the expertise of our partner, the Data  Conservancy, we are continually evolving our service model, and testing  by trial its sustainability and accommodation of diverse practices among  disciplines. We will report on the first year of our Data Management  Services program, focusing on planning support for NSF's data management  plan requirements, and the particular needs of social science. We have  developed tools, such as a questionnaire and in-person meetings, for  helping researchers with NSF's 2-page plan, and project management  workflows for depositing data into the JHU Data Archive. We will discuss  outreach strategies for publicizing our services, and incentives for  researchers to invest in data preservation and sharing. Case examples  from working with a range of social sciences illustrate data management  issues distinct from \u201cbig data\u201d sciences, such as sharing data with  personal identifiers, managing qualitative research, and  multi-disciplinary collaborations. With data management requirements  expanding among funders, innovations by academic libraries are of broad  interest to data curation professionals.",

Perhaps because of this, there has been a growing  interest in pursuing collaborative efforts to implement best practices  throughout the research data life cycle. Effective collaborations can be  local, involving individual researchers or research teams, or  large-scale initiatives involving multiple institutions in either  informal relationships or formal partnerships such as consortia. When  data is collected, processed, archived, or disseminated as part of a  collaborative process, the potential for problems is heightened - but so  are the rewards. This session will look at examples of effective  collaborative data management at all stages of the data life cycle, and  consider some of the challenges and potential successes at play when we  work together to improve data collection, preservation, and access.  Examples will range from landmark projects to emerging initiatives, and  include case studies from the Ontario Council of University Libraries  (OCUL), an academic library consortium",

The documentation of these studies consists of study  descriptions, variable descriptions with questions and answers, and  other material like methodological information. The datasets are  documented by tools that use the DDI-Codebook metadata standard  (formerly known as DDI 2). Since 2008, the DDI Alliance has published  the DDI-Lifecycle standard (DDI 3/DDI-L), that focuses on re-usable  documentation and the support of the full research data lifecycle. To  use some of the many advantages that DDI-L provides, a migration of the  available documentation should be conducted. The talk will focus on the  benefits and challenges of such a migration project, and will show  possible options during that process. The use of the recently published  DDI version 2.5 will be considered because it aims at making the  migration to DDI-L easier. The support of software for the format  conversion and for the necessary re-arrangement of documentation parts  will be investigated. The consequences of such a migration project for  the future maintenance of the data and documentation will be shown.",

The total amount studies in the holdings amounts to over one thousand,  both quantitative and qualitative. SND stores and indexes this metadata  using eXist-db, an open source XML database. Colectica is another DDI  3-based tool, but by default it uses a different repository structure  for storing metadata. In order to allow Colectica tools to interact with  SND metadata, we implemented a set of Web Services on top of eXist-db  that allow Colectica to store and load information using eXist-db. We  will demonstrate functionality provided by the eXist-db system, discuss  the steps we took to integrate with Colectica, and demonstrate the  resulting functionality with the two systems working together. We will  also present recommendations on how to interact between DDI repositories  in general and DDI tools. Implementations on our approach could be done  from other DDI repositories.",

                    "abstract": "DDI provides survey methodologists with ample metadata to describe  statistical survey design. However it is widely recognise that  description of processes is not enough, we must be able to use metadata  to drive statistical workflows. One particular goal is the ability to  automatically generate personalised and dynamic electronic forms from  structured metadata. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has conducted  research examining how this can be achieved through the novel use of XML  technologies to enhance standard DDI 3.1 XML. By examining the use of  XSL transforms, and XPath specifications embedded with DDI Lifecycle  metadata, we can provide metadata-driven 'industrialisation' to  statistical processes. To demonstrate this capability, this talk  presents a case study from the Australian Bureau of Statistics,  featuring a late-stage prototype of an XSLT system that automatically  creates dynamic web forms featuring complex question sequencing and  word-substitution in questions using DDI Lifecycle XML. This is  demonstrated using DDI3.1 that describes the complex series of ABS  instruments - Monthly Population Survey, which includes the Australian  Labour Force Survey as well as supplementary questionnaires.",

The Gateway enables researchers to find and explore variables  across longitudinal cohort studies, to support data linkage for new  research. A federated approach is used, whereby studies are responsible  for storing, preserving, curating and disseminating data; publishing  standardised metadata into the gateway. The system uses a Drupal content  management system and Apache solr search and browse functionality, with  metadata organised into modular units representing studies, time  periods, collection events and variables. Users can search and discover  variables across studies and export baskets of variables to request  access to data. The directory holds over 45,000 variables for four case  studies: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),  National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD), Southampton Women's  Study (SWS), Whitehall II. Variables for a further ten cohort studies  are being incorporated. Development towards a DDI3.1 metadata exchange  standard is ongoing, enabling metadata from diverse formats and  structures to be ingested into the gateway. MRC DSS also works closely  with research units towards integrated data management planning.",

In support of this work, a survey  of the various organization's metadata holdings has been explored, and  work undertaken to produce a metadata model for implementation in Work  Package 12. This metadata model will span both the Data Documentation  Initiative for documentaing microdata and the Statistical Data and  Metadata Exchange (SDMX) model for aggregate data holdings in the  statistical offices. while European researchers may be familiar with the  data holdings in their own national archives and statistical offices,  they may not have as great a familiarity with holdings in other European  countries.Aggregate data will be indexed and linked to microdata  holdings to provide for improved discovery capabilities for European  researchers. Similarities to the ongoing work on RDF expressions of SDMX  and DDI are also explored.",

The project aims to fill in data gaps that  limit research on taxation and to enhance the visibility of taxation  research methods and concepts. SDMX is used to capture and register both  metadata and research data that are collected in addition to data that  are publicly avaialble. An SDMX registry is used to populate a metadata  repository. An SDMX repository is used to store the taxation indicators  and the time series data that are collected by a macro economic research  group. SDMX was chosen as the preferred technology as this standard  interoperates with the existing infrastructure for statistical data  exchange and can be used for cross-disciplinary research suppport. The  CARDS project (Controlled Access to Research Data Storage) project was  granted by the SURFfoundation and ran from January to December 2011.",

Such merged data sets could only serve the scientific community,  if they are high quality. Thereby data documentation is of vital  importance, and no easy task. Data that accrued out of two different  sources needs an adjusted, standardized and easy to understand  documentation. The DDI standard can fulfil these needs. The Institute  for Employment Research (IAB) and the German Institute for Economic  Research (DIW Berlin) are two major data providers in Germany, the IAB  for administrative data and the DIW Berlin for survey data (German Socio  Economic Panel, SOEP). Within this presentation the authors will show  the challenges in implementing a standardized metadata documentation,  the importance of a well-suited documentation for data quality and the  advantages of an agreed data documentation for comparison and  combination of datasets. The focus will lie on the Data Documentation  Initiative (DDI), a metadata standard for research data.",

What are new are developments in advanced online tools  which help bring some of the same functionalities to the web, and in  doing so make the data more accessible to the masses. Each of these  solutions has its strengths and its weaknesses- depending on the goals  of the application. With a lack of complete solutions (particularly  non-commercial ones), custom application development is sometimes needed  to meet an institution's goals. Requiring an online  visualization/exploration tool for its election and demographic data  holdings, the CDSP has developed an application that provides certain  features key to its research community. Unlike with most existing tools,  the user is able to create custom variables from those already  available. Further, users can analyze multiple variables simultaneously  through a combination of choropleths, proportional circles, charts, and  tables. Also supported is the analysis of geospatial data across  changing administrative boundaries. Additionally, the user is able to  save the online application state for later analysis, as well as for  sharing with colleagues. The online application was developed using  entirely free and open source tools.",

With  the promotion of a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) by the INF project  (integral part of the SFB) advisory and developmental services in the  domain of information infrastructure will be provided. The VRE combines  both a work and a project-specific research platform. The work platform  bundles IT resources by bringing together various tools for  administration, project management, and time- and location-independent  collaboration work in a single environment adapted to researcher's  specific working processes. The research component combines data  management with further developments of social science methodologies. It  provides services for archiving and re-use of datasets and is  responsible for the infrastructural and methodological coordination of  the data documentation. Almost entire data life-cycle is documented by  implementing and applying DDI3 across all projects. In this talk, we  present the challenges and barriers in designing and building-up a VRE  for the social sciences. We mainly focus on documentation aspects,  especially on the unification of varying documentation requirements  which came up. Additionally, various key issues of research  collaboration, as an outcome of the user requirement analysis, will be  discussed.",

C.Jayet, R.Fleureux, A. Mack, Ch. Wolf \"(Servicing researchers in the  use of European OS microdata\") set forth the tools employed to cope with  the difficulties encountered in using the existing metadata standards  (DDI2 and 3) in the specific European case when documenting study  programmes, studies and datasets from numerous institutions and  countries and the metadata scheme proposed for documenting European  official microdata both at national and European level with the aim of  building a Service Centre for OS microdata in Europe. R. Silberman, P.  Tubaro, M. Cros, B. Kleiner (\"Access to official microdata and  researcher accreditation: State of the art and future perspectives in  Europe\") map similarities and differences in national access and  accreditation arrangements while pointing at commonalities for  inter-operability and, ideally, adoption of common standards.

M. Wittenberg,  M.Priddy, J.Sherpherdson (\"Desired portal functionality for effective  resource discovery on OS data across Europe\") present the work  undertaken about desired portal functionality for effective resource  discovery: researchers expectations, constraints due to diversity in  content and technical level of the various resources, metadata issues  and identify the next steps for a possible architecture for the portal.  C.Jayet, R.Fleureux, A. Mack, Ch. Wolf \"(Servicing researchers in the  use of European OS microdata\") set forth the tools employed to cope with  the difficulties encountered in using the existing metadata standards  (DDI2 and 3) in the specific European case when documenting study  programmes, studies and datasets from numerous institutions and  countries and the metadata scheme proposed for documenting European  official microdata both at national and European level with the aim of  building a Service Centre for OS microdata in Europe. R. Silberman, P.  Tubaro, M. Cros, B. Kleiner (\"Access to official microdata and  researcher accreditation: State of the art and future perspectives in  Europe\") map similarities and differences in national access and  accreditation arrangements while pointing at commonalities for  inter-operability and, ideally, adoption of common standards. D.  Schiller (\"A pilot for an European Remote Access Network - first results  and upcoming challenges\") presents preliminary outputs about the  concept and architecture of a European distributed remote access for  confidential official microdata coping with current legal constraints  within Europe, security and standard issues, technical feasibility and  researchers needs.",

Making  such materials available and usable to other researchers for secondary  analysis requires professional standards of documentation and  preparation of data, appropriate licensing arrangements, and ongoing  data management and user support. A key initiative on standards and data  management is taken by the DDI Alliance Qualitative Data Working Group.  The group has proposed a conceptual meta model adding to the  DDI-Lifecycle for qualitative data resources. An accompanying paper  presents the challenges for a unified approach towards managing,  archiving and accessing qualitative data, use of a controlled vocabulary  for producing metadata as well as a requirement analysis. Additionally  the paper introduces a number of cutting-edge tools for sharing and  re-using qualitative data developed by data archives, universities and  organisations. The session invites papers addressing all issues related  to the title: \u201cPreserving and organising qualitative social science data  resources for sharing and re-use on\u201d. ",

The goal is to articulate a general strategy of open research data access in Slovenia, in all scientific disciplines and in accordance with OECD principles. In order to assess the initial conditions in the area of data handling in a country we conducted a series of half-structured interviews with different target stakeholders. The emphasis was on stories about the problems foreseen in open data access, and about suggested solutions to overcome barriers. We would like to present results of that preliminary study. The questions were about the accountability and mutual expectations of various stakeholders such as data creators and users, specialised services (e.g. research libraries) and policymakers. We inquired about the existence of specialised competencies, and need for collaboration of different professional communities. Comparison with studies about situations in other countries shows prevailing similarity. Slovene scientific community expressed high level of awareness about best practices in data handling that steam from intensive international cooperation. Concern was expressed about the lack of policy of incentives to motivate additional data exchange, and little support infrastructure, together with the need to develop additional competencies in information service oriented activities.",

In a recent survey on the more than 3,000 active researchers in humanities and social sciences, however, 52% did not hear of SRDA. Among those who ever tried SRDA but gave up (N=257), 17% complained that information provided about data sets was insufficient for an effective search, and another 17% said similarly that they could not find what they needed. Basically, the improvements that SRDA must make are sketched in the above survey results, i.e., the promotion of SRDA and better and more metadata for the archived datasets. For these goals, we devise several strategies. First, produce demonstrations of uses of survey data sets on the website. Second, make power point files of SRDA introductions and send them to college professors for use in class or for research reference. Third, revise abstracts and keywords of datasets. Fourth, construct metadata on Nesstar. Fifth, add a search function that bridges the gap between the restricted and non-restricted data collections.",

The core is databases designed and maintained under the Moscow State University-based Information System RUSSIA The databases keep social and economic indicators at regional and local levels with annual and monthly update and are complimented by graphics- and map-based data visualization. System and comparative analysis tools are accomplished. Tutorials are implemented to train users. The first one is available to assist in evidence-based investigations in public administration. Work underway is on public administration domain ontology to integrate statistical indicators and analytical publications. The databases are available for free to all RF universities, colleges, think tanks, academic institutes, NGO, public libraries, specialists and citizens and serve for statistical culture dissemination in Russian society. The resource is of special value for local level powers - Russian national statistical agency Rosstat has only 3 years ago started to publish local level data. The UIS RUSSIA databases provide for more developed analytical services.",

For instance, while established (even if still developing) in the USA, the role of a designated \u201cdata librarian\u201d in the academic/research environment is something quite new in Germany; while the federal statistical system in the USA is based on the activities of several dozen individual agencies, Germany has a single Federal Statistical Office, along with at least equally important central statistical offices for each of its states; and the practice of conducting a nationwide census of the population is established and largely unchallenged in the USA, but was so controversial in (West) Germany in the 1980s that it would not be undertaken again until 2011. Meanwhile, the ideas and challenges of sharing research data, planning for its management, providing curation services and persistent identifiers at appropriate levels for social science datasets, and developing and sharing best practices increasingly cross national boundaries and provide increasing opportunities for collaboration - between people and institutions in these two nations, and well beyond.",

Did the name of the profession get coopted to something brand new? Or are these \"new breed\" data librarians remixing or rebranding skills that social science data librarians have acquired through time? Or does the proliferation and change of descriptions actually signal a maturation of the profession? In this paper we will analyze position descriptions from job ads for data-related positions (largely in the US  Canada) from the last 4 years, present some in-depth case studies of data librarians in various forms, map the positions in their organizational contexts, and submit some suggestions for future job description language and content to the IASSIST audience for scrutiny and reflection.",

                    "abstract": "Funding agencies increasingly require detailed plans for data management, sharing, and archiving during the grant submission process. Researchers may lack the knowledge required to design and implement a feasible plan for long term storage and secondary analysis of their data, such as technical specifications, metadata standards, and archival challenges pertinent to the types of data they will collect. Librarians, information specialists, and grants compliance administrators in university settings are the natural partners of these researchers; however, these partners may also lack the necessary expertise in managing the data lifecycle. This paper will report the extent to which programs in schools of library and information science (LIS) are formally preparing students for positions in data curation and data librarianship. The results of a content analysis (currently in progress) of North American LIS program websites (iSchools caucus members and American Library Association-accredited programs) will be presented. This presentation will offer a comprehensive snapshot of the courses, certifications, tracks of study, centers/institutes, and grant-funded initiatives that are currently available to those who wish to work in data curation, in the hopes of initiating a conversation about the skills and knowledge needed by data professionals and how LIS programs can help to prepare them.",

The RUresearch Data Team brings together subject librarians, metadata librarians, and the technical staff working with the RUresearch data portal. The goal of the course is to instill in all team members a baseline knowledge of all aspects of data management necessary to support faculty's research data needs. The entire team meets together approximately monthly for a two hour class. In between class sessions, group homework assignments and discussion reinforce the concepts. The class modules cover these topics and more: the data model; metadata; controlled vocabularies, ontologies, and linked data; data preservation and reuse; the data lifecycle; use cases; designing a research portal; and workflow management. The presentation will present the findings from interviews of course participants and instructors that explore their reactions to the course. What do subject librarians without prior exposure to data issues take away from it? How does learning about the data needs of researchers affect technical staff? What lessons did the Libraries learn from running such a course? This presentation will provide the answers.",

                    "abstract": "What do researchers need from archives? What do archives need from researchers? These questions cover two types of researchers that encounter data archives: data creators and data reusers. These groups have different needs and it is archives that mediate between them. The role of an archive for creators is to support them in producing quality data, metadata and documentation and to facilitate wide and multipurpose data dissemination. By supporting multipurpose reuse to the fullest extent possible, archives help realise the value of public investment in academic research. This paper discusses the optimisation of research data management training and support for research data creators and data dissemination and long-term preservation for social science data archives. It outlines the GESIS plan to create a research data management and archive training centre for the cessda-ERIC European research area, to cater for both data supply and data demand. The training centre will look to ensure excellence in the creation and long-term preservation of reusable data in the cessda-ERIC area, contribute to promoting and adaptating standards in research data management and promote data availability and reuse. Finaly, the centre will provide and coordinate training on technologies and tools used by data professionals.",

Analysts may access these data in-real  time through data archives, research data centers, remote access  facilities, secure data enclaves, and virtual data centers, and more.  They may also access confidential microdata through4 buffered access  (e.g., remote batch execution) wherein users submit code through an  online system and the output is reviewed manually for statistical  disclosure concerns. Some data access systems, for example online  tabulation engines and remote analysis systems, now even automate the  batch execution process and provide output straight back to the user,  after having gone through an automated disclosure process. Speakers in  this session will address the advantages and disadvantages of each of  these data access modalities focusing specifically on data protection,  analytic utility, cost effectiveness, and researcher convenience.",

The technologies  deployed are scalable for the full collection of 670 Post Office  Directories covering the whole of Scotland. Phase 2 funding has  developed functionality complementary to the original work and broadened  geographic coverage of content. Work included spatial searching, and  enhancing the geo-parsing process via discreet configuration files.  Multiple addresses (i.e. entries where individuals have more than one  domestic address) were also made explicit for searching purposes.  Additional content for Edinburgh as well as Glasgow and Aberdeen (1881,  1886, 1891) to coincide with census (and an inter-census) years has been  incorporated into the web tool, and a mobile Augmented Reality  application will be added shortly. This presentation will discuss in  more detail the social and technical approaches adopted in both phases  of the project.",

                    "abstract": "The University of Melbourne's eScholarship Research Centre is currently  working on a number of projects requiring the preparation, submission,  preservation and dissemination of multiple types of information. Work on  the Saulwick Age-Poll Archive involves paper-based and digital  archives, a digital guide to records, micro-data from political polls  managed by the Australian Data Archive (ADA), and the proposed  development of a context layer to maintain authoritative information on  key people, organisations, events and subjects. Similarly, work on  important historical social science data collected by Wilfred Prest and  the Reverend Robert Richard U'Ren has involved extracting that data from  hard-copy archival records for deposit with ADA. Drawing on these  examples, we will explore the benefits of treating context, records and  data as separate (but interrelated) 'layers', each with their own  requirements and limitations. There are challenges involved,  particularly when managing boundaries and information flows between each  layer. Addressing these through effective collaboration between  'traditional' archives, data archives and contextual information  managers is essential to success; and the needs of all three elements  need to be considered and balanced to fully realise the potential of  historical and current research data and related material.",

                    "abstract": "Traditionally, textbooks treating early American history have been  written with Anglo-American biases. While many facts are irrefutable,  certain socio-cultural perspectives have tainted the multicultural  reality of American history. In conventional textbooks, initial English  colonies are prominent, yet settlements established contemporaneously by  the French and Spanish receive little attention. Growth of Britain's  thirteen colonies is presented. However, Spanish development (Florida,  Mexico) and French establishments (Canada, Mississippi, Gulf of Mexico)  are hardly mentioned. After the American Revolution, the focus is on the  nation's westward expansion, including the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis  and Clark's Expedition. Yet germane facts remain neglected: Napoleon  sold Louisiana due to political uprisings in Saint-Domingue. Sacagawea  was indispensable to the success of Lewis and Clark, who might not have  survived without her unique communicative capabilities in several Native  American languages. Appreciation for America's multicultural past could  be enriched by linking multi-perspective narratives to digital  reproductions of historic maps, letters, journals, treatises, etc.  written in English and other languages. Unfortunately, many historic  documents remain inaccessible. This study first considers incorporation  of authentic digital resources into educational materials and then  explores tensions between \u201cfair use\u201d and institutions' claims of  copyright protection over reproductions of public domain works housed in  their collections.",

                    "abstract": "Metadata practitioners and standards developers typically take  classifications as given. Rarely do they look at how these were created  and whether they make sense for respondents or data users. This talk  will break tradition and discuss this issue. We considered a question in  the Current Population Survey in the US on self-employment, called  Class of Worker (COW). The COW question reads: \u201cWere you employed by  government, a private company, a non-profit organization, or were you  self-employed (or working in the family business)?\u201d The basic question  was whether these four response options make sense together. Said  another way, does the COW classification make sense for data users?  Based on research done by the Small Business Administration and  independent researchers, we suspected the answer was No. To investigate  this, we paid 90 volunteers to come to BLS and classify a set of twelve  job description vignettes based on two different groupings of the COW  classification. The data show answering COW is a difficult task. Using  research from cognitive psychology, we are now able to provide reasons  for this, and we propose new roles for metadata practitioners and new  considerations for metadata standards developers.",

                    "abstract": "Comparative social researchers are often confronted with the challenge  of making key theoretical concepts comparable across nations and/or  time. One example is the socio-demographic variable \u2018Education'. To  operationalize \u2018education' researchers must review multiple educational  systems across nations and/or changing educational structures within one  nation across time. Further, researchers have multiple ways to recode  education into a harmonized variable including (inter alia): the  Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik/Warner matrix; the CASMIN education scheme; the  International Standard Classification of Education; or a harmonized  variable provided by the dataset itself. GESIS is developing two  electronic resources to assist social researchers. The website DataCoH  (Data Coding and Harmonization) will provide a centralized online  library of data coding and harmonization for existing variables to  increase transparency and variable replication. DataCoH initially will  contain socio-demographic variables used across the social sciences and  then expand to discipline-specific variables. The software program  Charmstats (Coding and Harmonizing Statistics) will provide a structured  approach to data harmonization by allowing researchers to: 1) download  harmonization protocols; 2) document variable coding and harmonization  processes; 3) access variables from existing datasets for harmonization;  and 4) create harmonization protocols for publication and citation.  This paper explains DataCoH and Charmstats and demonstrates how they  work.",

                    "abstract": "The International Standard for Classification of Education (ISCED) is at  the heart of national and international statistical agencies' reporting  on education. Over the last years, ISCED is also increasingly used by  official and non-official survey programmes in the measurement of  educational attainment. This even if ISCED 1997, the current version of  the standard up to recently, is quite complex and does not contain a  classification of educational attainment. In November 2011, UNESCO  launched a new ISCED version. ISCED 2011 has a numeric coding framework,  separate classifications for educational programmes and educational  attainment, and more details at the level of tertiary education.  Conceptual clarifications compared to the previous version are also  made, and in sum ISCED has become more user-friendly. It is thus  expected that its use will increase in the coming years. The DDI  Lifecycle has a storing module called a resource package, that  structures materials for publication that are intended for reuse by  multiple studies, projects or user communities. This presentation  focuses on how ISCED 2011 metadata components usefully can be structured  in a DDI resource package, for the benefit of reuse by reference by  national and international statistical agencies, as well as official and  non-official survey programmes.",
