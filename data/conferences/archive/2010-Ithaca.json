                    "abstract": "This session focuses on a project with a remit to produce some evidence  of how teachers use data resources, and the impact on student learning.  There is concern about levels of data and statistical literacy skills of  UK social science students, even though the cutting edge of social  science is reliant on use of real world datasets, and there is a great  desire to improve research-led teaching in the area. The project  collates the experience of attempts to upskill students in data and its  discipline-related usage, and provides an illustration of educational  practice at both discipline and national level. The case studies  showcase attempts to make learning and teaching about and with data a  less passive experience. The UK national data centres provide access to a  wealth of social science data - provided by national census agencies,  and inter governmental organisations including the OECD, IMF, UN and  World Bank - for undergraduate and postgraduate study. Students often  avoid handling and discussing data in their study unless forced to  confront it. The challenge for educators lies in promoting students' use  of data, but the benefits in doing so improve both academic performance  and job prospects for students.",

With the advent of the 2010 Census, we are in the process of a  many-pronged outreach effort related to the 2010 Census. The purpose is  to reach communities that could/should be using census data to inform  their stories, lives, and research. We also want to underscore the  importance in participating in the 2010 Census. The first effort was a  Census 2010 Boot Camp for Journalists, which provided 25 journalists  with training to understand the importance of census data and how to  analyze the data for local and national stories: http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/McCormick  In the second effort we are sponsoring an ad contest (YouTube-like),  where students create short videos encouraging participation with the  2010 Census. The \u2018hard-to-count\u2019 areas in Ann Arbor are the  student-dominated university neighborhoods. Finally, we will be teaching  a one-credit course in Winter 2010 on \u201cThe United States Census.\u201d  Portions of the course will be presented in other classes throughout the  academic term. The presentation will discuss the challenges and rewards  of outreach to new communities.",

As a unit within the Center for Social Research and Data Archives, Institute of Social Science, University of Tokyo, SSJDA aims to promote empirical research on Japan in the social sciences, and has been disseminating survey data since April, 1998. The total number of available datasets is about 1,200 in the end of 2008. SSJDA plays the role of a major data provider for those who seek to analyze the Japanese society using micro data. This presentation discusses the recent efforts in developing the internet based system at SSJDA. SSJDA has an on-line searching system powered by full-text search engine. It has also developed an on-line data provision system which started to operate from April 2009. The English version of the same system will be made public early in 2010. In addition, SSJDA has just started to consider the adoption of DDI seriously.",

The IFSS is designed to  provide harmonized data files from 10 national surveys of women's union  formation and fertility behavior.  The surveys belong to 3 separate  survey series:  (1) Growth of American Families (1955, 1960), (2)  National Fertility Survey (1965, 1970) and the (3) National Survey of  Family Growth (1973, 1976, 1982, 1988, 1995, 2002).    The presenters  will have harmonized data available to demonstrate the harmonization  method and the delivery method for the data files, and will also  describe their harmonized cross-sectional weights and design components,  which can be applied to analyses across time.   \t  The Minnesota Population Center (MPC) is one of the world's  leading developers of demographic data resources (including IPUMS-USA,  IPUMS International, IPUMS-CPS, NHGIS, NAPP, and IHIS) .  In this  workshop, attendees will learn about the content of the latest MPC data  resources and receive basic information about how to get and use the  data, which are available free over the internet.  A special focus of  this workshop will be the MPC's newest project, ATUS-X, which provides  harmonized American Time Use Survey data from 2003 forward on how U.S.  adults divide their time among activities.  ATUS-X is an MPC project  conducted in cooperation with researchers at the University of Maryland  Population Research Center.",

It runs under all the  major operating systems and has an enormous and expanding collection of  add-on packages to support data analysis in almost every imaginable  domain. It's downside, though, is that R is almost entirely command line  driven, giving it a steeper learning curve than commercial software  options like SAS, SPSS, and Stata. \tThis workshop will focus  on R's unique command syntax. In particular, we'll explore how to load  and manipulate data in R. Examples will be similar to those used in the  morning SAS, Stata, and SPSS workshop.",

We will first overview the software available for screencast creation  and then discuss best practices in creating screencast tutorials,  including length, audience, and scripting. In the second portion,  participants will write a short script and practice using Jing!  to create their own screencast tutorials for a chosen data product.  Finally, participants will discuss the place of screencast tutorials in  the data world with the goal of creating best practices guidelines for  data-oriented screencast tutorials. Participants will leave the workshop  with a finished draft of a screencast tutorial as well as guidelines  and suggestions for future tutorials.",

The IFSS is designed to  provide harmonized data files from 10 national surveys of women's union  formation and fertility behavior.  The surveys belong to 3 separate  survey series:  (1) Growth of American Families (1955, 1960), (2)  National Fertility Survey (1965, 1970) and the (3) National Survey of  Family Growth (1973, 1976, 1982, 1988, 1995, 2002).    The presenters  will have harmonized data available to demonstrate the harmonization  method and the delivery method for the data files, and will also  describe their harmonized cross-sectional weights and design components,  which can be applied to analyses across time.   \t  The Minnesota Population Center (MPC) is one of the world's  leading developers of demographic data resources (including IPUMS-USA,  IPUMS International, IPUMS-CPS, NHGIS, NAPP, and IHIS) .  In this  workshop, attendees will learn about the content of the latest MPC data  resources and receive basic information about how to get and use the  data, which are available free over the internet.  A special focus of  this workshop will be the MPC's newest project, ATUS-X, which provides  harmonized American Time Use Survey data from 2003 forward on how U.S.  adults divide their time among activities.  ATUS-X is an MPC project  conducted in cooperation with researchers at the University of Maryland  Population Research Center.",

                    "abstract": "With few precedents to follow, libraries and librarians who are  beginning to explore their potential roles in data curation are  grappling to relate their training and experience as librarians to the  development and stewardship of data collections. In 2008, a group of  librarians at Purdue University conducted an exercise to learn more  about what data curation might mean to them in practical terms by  identifying and engaging potential data contributors on campus.  Subject-specialist librarians engaged six data creators from different  disciplines, each in their own way, to solicit contributions from them.  The librarians were asked to report back with a collection-level  description of the dataset, their rationale for its selection, and a  narrative of how they engaged and interacted with the data creator to  answer questions such as, \u201cHow should the dataset be presented in the  repository?\u201d and \u201cWhat policies are needed for its submission, use, and  preservation?\u201d The datasets were then ingested into a prototype data  repository. This session will present the structure of the exercise  along with vignettes to illustrate the challenges, issues, and insights  of the librarians from their perspectives.",

                    "abstract": "IR Plus is a new, open source platform for institutional repositories.  Based on several years of user research, IR Plus was written to support  faculty and grad students in the creation phases of their research,  rather than just being a receptacle for finished work. For social  scientists, the format-agnostic personal workspace supports storing and  sharing large datasets, allowing them to collaborate with colleagues all  over the world. When the work is ready for \"publication\" into the  repository, a controlled but flexible approach to metadata allows easy  addition of new types while keeping the overall metadata clean. Bringing  the repository closer to social networking systems, users of the system  can showcase and provide access to their work through Researcher Pages,  which are easy to create and maintain. Users can now also feature  \"personal publications\" on their Researcher Pages: material from the  workspace that has not been added to any of the collections in the  repository. While IR Plus was not created just for data users, we feel  IASSIST members will find a number of its features interesting and  useful, and it provides a study of a formal, institutional system edging  into the world of social networking and collaboration.",

                    "abstract": "This paper will discuss the findings of the RIN-funded Case Studies in  Life Sciences project, undertaken by a team of social scientists and  information specialists from the Institute for the Study of Science,  Technology and Innovation (ISSTI) and from Information Services and the  Digital Curation Centre (DCC) at the University of Edinburgh. The aim of  the project was to improve understanding of information use in the life  sciences, and to provide a broader and deeper base of evidence to  inform discussions about how information policy and practice can most  effectively be supported and improved. Case studies were conducted  across laboratories and research groups from 7 sub-disciplines of the  life sciences and deployed a range of methodologies and tools including  short-term ethnographic techniques and semi-structured instruments. Our  key conclusion indicates that policies and strategies of research  funders and information service providers must be informed by an  understanding of the constraints and practices of different research  communities. Only thus will they be effective in optimising use and  exchange of information, and in ensuring that they are scientifically  productive and cost-effective The full report \u2018Patterns of information  use and exchange: case studies of researchers in the life sciences\u2019 is  available at: http://www.rin.ac.uk/case-studies.",

The Roper Center and the National  Archives and Records Administration have identified, rescued, and made  these data available to the research community. The third talk describes  a new alliance between ICPSR and Institutional Repositories (IRs) with  the goal of preserving and re-using social science data. This talk  focuses on the formation of these partnerships; how an archiving guide  for IRs will be developed; and new services that ICPSR can offer to IRs  to assist with social science data. The fourth talk summarizes the  efforts of ICPSR and the Roper Center to migrate punched card data to  modern preservation formats. This presentation focuses on the recovery  of the Cornell Retirement Study, a longitudinal study that began in  1952.  The final talk discusses the current collaborative structure of  Data-PASS, our agreements, infrastructure, and the services and  infrastructure available to new partners.",

To achieve these objectives DDA  began in the fall of 2008 to produce a workbench-style DDI editor  architected in such a way that layers can be swapped out and replaced,  e.g. backend persistence and DDI 3 id generation. The editor has an  Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) as the front end and a public API for  developers, both licensed as open source software.",

This paper will also present some of the findings from this  study and will outline its recommended models for delivering  collaborative data services over the Web. It will examine areas of  overlap and similarity between the social sciences and the humanities,  as well as identifying areas of difference and distinctiveness.",

A new cooperative project with the World Bank and  Paris21 is completing the data/metadata loop with contributing  countries by creating DDI documentation for the original data sets  included in our collection and returning it to the country of origin.  These DDI files can then be used with the IHSN Microdata Toolkit and  locally held data files to provide new levels of access to microdata as  well as create new aggregate tables. We will discuss the challenges of  integrating metadata across such varied data samples, and the techniques  developed to manage these challenges.",

The practice of data curation remained a  concept with no known practice untill around the 2000's. Ever since the  introduction of the Multimedia Data Management Toolkit developed by the  International Household Survey Network (IHSN), Africa has embraced the  practice of data preservation. A number of countries have adopted the  toolkit as the principle method of data documentation and archiving. The  number of countries using and planning to use the toolkit increase by  the day. This very positive development however has its own challenges  and thereby calls for collaborative support from other development  partners. The African Development Bank and United Nations Economic  Commission for Africa are among the few who have joined hands to further  this cause. The purpose of the paper will be to highlight the new  inititives and re-echo the need to develop regional capacities to  support data curation through collegial networks.",

Whereas initially Cornell depended solely on manual curation for  the accumulation of content, much of the information is now  automatically ingested from local data resources. VIVO stores data as  distributed sets of Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements  using concepts and properties from standard ontologies. Employing Linked  Data principles (http://linkeddata.org),  globally unique identifiers (URIs) for the national network\u2019s resources  are directly dereferenceable on the Web, allowing access to the RDF  data using standard HTTP requests while presenting human users with a  standard HTML representation through any Web browser. Resources at one  distributed VIVO node can directly link to resources at any other VIVO  node or to other similarly published resources on the Web, allowing  automated clients to crawl, analyze, and re-represent the graph of data.  Information from local VIVO systems will be aggregated into distributed  indexing nodes for full text or RDF queries using the SPARQL language,  for network analysis, and for visualization. VIVO has been independently  deployed at multiple universities in the U.S, and in Australia and  China. The NIH VIVO project will address scalability through multiple  independently administered but coordinated installations sharing a  common, extensible ontology and supporting direct cross-linking as  described above. VIVO can therefore provide a customized and extensible  presence at the diverse participating institutions and provide  convincing and varied models for propagation under full local  institutional control in the national context. The ability to create and  add additional content models and integration with existing data  resources are supported.",

IntegraL adopts a  \u201clightweight\u201d mechanism that connects data across content service  providers and makes different forms of digital content interoperable.  IntegraL facilitates a virtual restructuring of public web spaces and  services, with authenticated digital libraries into broad \u201cfederated\u201d  digital library spaces constructed from numerous interrelationships.  Elements reside within a rich context of meta-information that helps  users understand and work with them. This provides a ripe environment  for organizations and individual people to develop small, specialized  collections and services, which automatically become part of the  federated space and accessible to those they can benefit. IntegraL  extends the boundaries of how we think about and interact with digital  libraries. Our study indicates that IntegraL helps to enhance search  productivity. Users find IntegraL useful in locating relevant  information. IntegraL also helps users to do tasks more effectively.  Users are confident of IntegraL\u2019s ability to perform satisfactory search  results. IntegraL is mostly built on open-source software, which can be  reliable, auditable and cost-effective. The broader impact of this  study is that it provides recommendations to users for further deep  search among wide ranges of virtual resources.",

This presentation discusses the work of the  RUCore Data Working Group in setting format and metadata standards for  datasets, designing an architecture appropriate to data in our Fedora  repository, and creating a web interface that makes the datasets and  related RUCore collections discoverable. Relevant comparisons to peer  institutions and digital curation practices are discussed. The data  service is being prototyped through our work with faculty in the School  of Engineering and the School of Communication and Information. This  faculty research data, along with examples of datasets acquired by the  Libraries that need preservation, provide the initial testbed for the  RUCore Data Service. Development will continue on a complete curation  lifecycle for datasets, from initial deposit to versioning and revision.",

The  project addresses issues of protection of the privacy, sustainable  storage of video and audio, documentation of interviews, enrichment of  data. The second project, \u2018Veteran Tapes VP,\u2019 encourages re-use of  qualitative data and experiments with publication of research results.  The project aims at the realisation of an \u2018enriched publication\u2019 based  on a research corpus of transcribed interviews of Dutch veterans. In  this project we work together with a group of scholars from a number of  scientific disciplines and universities.

                    "abstract": "Economists Online (http://www.economistsonline.org)  is a portal that contains research outputs from Europe\u2019s top Economics  institutions. One of the unique features of this portal is that datasets  created as part of the research process are also included, linked  directly to the publications they are associated with.  Economists  Online now features content from around the world, but retains a strong  European focus. The NEREUS consortium (http://www.nereus4economics.info)  maintain the portal and are strong advocates of Open Access. The portal  represents the type of open international infrastructure that  researchers increasingly call for. By including datasets, many research  datasets have become openly available for the first time as a result.   The Datasets themselves are stored in a specialist data repository  system, Harvard\u2019s Dataverse. Economists Online harvests metadata from  the Dataverse and displays information about each dataset in the portal  along side its related publication. The Dataverse uses DDI metadata  standards to describe each dataset, and each dataset is grouped by  institution.  This presentation will explain some of the technical  hurdles faced, such as selecting the best infrastructure to use,  agreeing on standard metadata across participating institutions, as well  as the challenges faced in gaining author permission to make their  research data open access as part of Economists Online.",

The SQB is delivering a range of strategies across the 'traditional-through-innovative' spectrum to get users involved in the service. Traditional features include the 'top-down' delivery of news via mailing lists and newsfeeds. The service has also used twitter (www.twitter.com/surveynetacuk) and Methodspace (www.methodspace.com/groups/surveyresourcesnetwork) to encourage greater 'bottom-up' activity. Most innovatively, the service will soon introduce an interactive element to its forthcoming survey question database, allowing users to comment on survey questions.nbsp;Later in 2010, the SQB will be investigating how it might house a 'grey literature' repository so that users might find a home for their previously unpublished resources/tools, papers, presentations etc. This presentation will describe these strategies and review early successes and failures.",

Reproducible computational research, in  which all details of computations \u2014 code and data \u2014 are made  conveniently available to others, is a necessary response to this  crisis. Questions emerge regarding scientists' incentives and  motivations to share. This talk presents results from a survey of  computational scientists to determine the factors that facilitate code  and data sharing and those that create barriers. One major result finds  that sharing is done for reasons other than direct personal gain, but  when scientists choose not to reveal data or code this is due to  perceived personal impact. A second major finding is the prominence of  Intellectual Property concerns with regard to not sharing code and data.  Solutions to the various barriers are discussed, including how the  \"Reproducible Research Standard\" (Stodden 2008), which proposes a  licensing structure consonant with scientific norms, can thus encourage  open sharing in scientific research.",

                    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that the majority of social science data is  not preserved or shared through social science data archives and other  formal archival arrangements. This motivates further investigation about  the various ways researchers share their data (including more  \u201cinformal\u201d data sharing) and the factors that underlie their data  sharing behavior. We developed a survey to collect information from  principal investigators (PIs) of federally funded research grants in the  US about their experiences with data sharing (n=1,021). We also  collected information about various factors that might be related to  data sharing behavior including: normative data sharing practices in  their discipline, perceived barriers to data sharing, rank/tenure,  institutional type, gender and so on. We find that while only 12% of the  PIs have archived their data, 45% have shared their data outside the  immediate research team. Being in a discipline that favors data sharing  is positively associated with the likelihood that a PI shares his or her  research data. Perceived barriers to data sharing reduce the likelihood  one shares data. Other factors associated with data sharing include  rank/tenure status and duration of the grant. Implications for data  archives are also discussed.",

                    "abstract": "Recently the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD) has taken part in  a pilot project by the National Digital Library which intends to  develop organisations\u2019 readiness to \"make the transition into an  electronic operating environment\". The project conducted a series of  surveys in late 2009 measuring the organisations\u2019 data management  quality and maturity. At FSD we would want to believe that we already  operate electronically. This presentation summarises the findings of the  report. The Digital Library project aims to create a centralised  long-term preservation solution for the digital cultural objects, and  later, for research data too. The project participants vary from large  national institutions to regional museums and private archives. Finding a  single solution that would ensure long-term preservation and  dissemination will be a challenge. Sharing of competence, building  partnerships and monitoring international development are crucial for  success. This presentation seeks to answer the following questions: How  does a national data archive do when compared to libraries, traditional  archives and museums (\"LAMs\")? What could be the mutual benefits of  actively working with the LAMs in the field of long-term preservation?  Metadata used in and by the LAMs differ notably from research data  documentation. How to approach other metadata formats than DDI?",

                    "abstract": "Since its establishment in 2005, Data Archiving  Networked Services (DANS) has been storing and making research data in the arts and humanities and social sciences permanently accessible. To this end DANS itself develops permanent archiving services, stimulates others to follow suit, and works closely with data managers to ensure as much data as possible is made freely available for use in scientific research. Economic sustainability is a key issue for DANS. For this reason DANS initiated a research project in 2007 to have a better understanding of the costs of digital archiving. DANS adopted and adjusted two managerial models, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and the Activity Based Costing (ABC) model. The design of the ABC model is based on DANS activities which are categorized in five clusters: Administration, Networked Services, ICT (RD and maintenance), Data Acquisition and Archiving. The Balanced Scorecard of DANS builds on the following business perspectives: Impact, Enablers/Users, Processes and Supporters. Fifteen success factors are allocated to them. The success factors are further specified with over forty performance indicators. During this presentation we will explain how the data generated by the models can be combined and can be used as decision making instruments regarding project specific costs, funding-related decisions, and predicting expenses.",

On the other hand it seeks to show how, alongside  strong access restrictions, it can make ever more of documents and  service provisions compiled from the database (e. g. Archontology\u2014 https://www.abtl.hu/archontologia \u2014and the photographic database https://www.abtl.hu/spyOne/anonymous)  fully publicly accessible on the Internet or accessible by special  privilege (e. g. to researchers).

The project objectives include: documenting the concerns and expectations of research funding agencies, researchers and potential users; evaluating and enhancing IQDA protocols and procedures, especially in relation to evaluation research, through a participatory process of preparing qualitative data from CDI for archiving; dissemination of the outcomes of the project through the CDI and IQDA websites. It is intended that the partnership will act as a major demonstrator project for the promotion of qualitative data archiving and re-use across the Irish social science communities. The project has been co-funded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and Tallaght West CDI.",

From its inception, the Afrobarometer project has worked with a network of partners, based in Africa and the United States, to generate scientifically reliable data on public opinion in Africa while at the same time aiming to strengthen institutional capacity for survey research in Africa. Additionally, the Afrobarometer has also sought to widely disseminate and apply its results to various stakeholders, including those based in Africa and outside of the continent. This presentation will offer an overview of the Afrobarometer project in the preceding ten years, identifying some of the key achievements made in realizing its objectives as well as some of the challenges encountered in carrying out survey research in Africa.",

We see this in the digital  repository domain, where the notion of a digital repository began as a  predominantly institutional phenomenon, or in certain cases a  disciplinary phenomenon, but is now evolving to a point where  repositories are becoming integrated components of larger systems and  distributed infrastructure.  At the same time, we see the emergence of  cloud technologies that offer large-scale storage and compute  capabilities, but with open questions on how well the cloud will meet  the requirements of digital preservation and data archiving.   In this  session, I will discuss how the DuraSpace not-for-profit organization is  working to evolve open source repositories and cloud services to serve  as core components within emerging data cyberinfrastructure.  In  collaboration with the Fedora and DSpace communities, we are positioning  repositories and cloud services to become part of a distributed data  curation and archiving fabric that encompasses both institutional  systems and the Web.   I will also provide highlights from the DuraSpace  partnership with the Data Conservancy, an NSF-funded Datanet project",

Submitting scientific data for ingest into a digital data repository  prior to the end of a research, data collection, or data creation  project facilitates collaborative preparation of data and metadata while  project resources are still available. Engaging data producers earlier  in the scientific data lifecycle should improve preparation of  scientific data and metadata for future use and dissemination. We  describe here the design of a data submission and workflow system aimed  at providing flexible capabilities for organizing the contributions of  interdisciplinary producers of scientific data, reviewers, and  archivists. The system provides a framework for iterative improvement in  the range and quality of information obtained from data sources as data  products are developed and finalized and for integration of this  workflow with selection and appraisal processes by community reviewers  and digital archivists, taking into account both discovery and  preservation metadata needs.",

                    "abstract": "This paper will present the public access metadata tools and services  developed by the UK's 'Data Management through e-Social Science'  research Node (www.dames.org.uk).  Requirements of the Node are to curate and distribute data resources  linked with a number of specialist topics (data on occupations;  educational qualifications; ethnicity and immigration; social care; and  e-Health data). Heterogeneous data formats and structures can be  identified. Most resources are generated through academic research, and  are typically freely distributed, but lacking in firm standards of  preparation. Services are required to collect, process, and subsequently  distribute these data resources for the benefit of social science  research. Metadata tools and services have been prepared to generate  metadata on the relevant resources. This occurs principally in the form  of an online 'data curation tool' which is intended to be accessible to  non-specialists. Metadata collected through the tool is stored in DDI  format (DDI 3), through which it can subsequently be exploited for  further data analysis and organisational tasks, including facilitating  the further distribution of the data. This paper will describe the  currently available tools, and ongoing issues in designing and employng  these metadata-oriented tools and services.",

                    "abstract": "There is a lot of discussion about the advantages of DDI 3, but many  people wonder if it is worth all the complexity. Moving to DDI 3  involves complex structures, tools, workflows, infrastructure and  expensive documentation efforts. The DatapluS project demonstrates the  added value of these efforts by providing a concrete use case where  publications are enriched with variable-level information about the  research process. The project consists of two tools for researchers, the  Enhanced Publications Editor (EPE) and the Subject portal, and the  required infrastructure to integrate these tools with the data from the  archives. The EPE enables authors to link their publications to datasets  and variables in the archives and with additional metadata of how they  did their research. The Subject Portal publishes the resulting  information and uses it to provide an enhanced search interface for  researchers. The strength of DatapluS is the collaboration between data  archives, libraries, and research organizations. By aligning their  existing responsibilities with those needed for the project, they can  now serve the researchers using an efficient and sustainable  infrastructure. These lessons learned show that strategic collaboration  can efficiently provide advanced services and benefits for the  researchers using DDI 3 infrastructure.",

This was a paradox as extensive data is collected  from around the world with the primary aim of maintaining global  financial stability. This failing of our current socioeconomic data  framework, combined with a more widespread dissatisfaction with the  present state of statistical information on economies and societies,  prompted French president Nicholas Sarkozy to set up a commission  designed to identify the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic  performance. In this talk, we discuss the outcomes and likely impact of  the commission which reported in 2009. We also consider the production  of more relevant indicators of social progress, assess the feasibility  of alternative measurement tools and discuss the likelihood of their  adoption. International data are also widely used by the research  community, and we also present here the results of a preliminary  analysis of the ESDS International web server logs showing the countries  and indicators preferentially chosen by academics when looking for data  to support their research. These results tell us about the kind of data  researchers choose when looking for data to support their research and  the future directions we should consider as providers and facilitators  of cross-national data.",

Welfare,  employment, income tax, support programs for pregnant and parenting  teens, scholarship applications, can, among many others be mined for  insights into social and economic behavior of specialized  sup-populations of the general population. This source of information  comes at a price of diligence in understanding the statistical universe  you are utilizing, dealing with dirty data (duplicate records, missing  data, confusing data), protection of the privacy of individuals and  understanding the peculiar structure and operations of particular data  processing systems within operational social programs. This presentation  will draw from the UC DATA\u2019s experience of more than a decade of social  science research using administrative data. It is hoped that our  experience can enlighten and prepare others for the challenge and  rewards of preparing and repurposing administrative records for research  uses that they were not originally designed. Administrative data will  be compared (in terms of utility, accuracy and completeness) with  rigorously design social survey data.",

Apparently similar  concepts such as part-time work, or permanent vs. temporary employment,  are often not strictly comparable using published aggregate data.  Surveys designed to gather data for national policy reasons do not  automatically generate data that are comparable for use in  cross-national studies. Harmonizing these concepts and definitions  involves considering their deployment in national contexts in order to  assure that cross-national comparisons are truly comparing likes with  likes. The Comparative Perspectives Database (still under development)  is a project that is attempting to generate comparative  multi-dimensional data tables on aspects of precarious employment, using  the microdata from a total of seven surveys spanning thirty countries  (Canada, United States, European Union (EU-27) and Australia). I will  discuss in detail some of the problems we encountered in producing a  codebook that would allow us to produce useful cross-national data  tables, as well as describe other similar projects conducted elsewhere.",

Based on a multicohort sequence design 60,000 target persons  within six starting cohorts will be followed through their life course.  The main aims of the NEPS are to increase the knowledge about the  development of competencies, the impact of learning environments, social  inequality and educational decisions, educational acquisition with  migration background, and the returns of education. The NEPS data will  be stored in a data warehouse. A data warehouse and the tools of  Business Intelligence provide a higher level of flexibility than  ordinary file servers or conventional transactional databases. Some of  these additional opportunities are: Easier access to the data, data can  be offered in different dimensions for various statistical packages  (such as Stata), data from different sources can be matched, the user  can build his/her own private use files (e. g., by selecting variables  depending on the personal needs via a shopping basket), results and new  computed variables can be easily stored within the data warehouse for  further use by different users, the statistical power within the data  warehouse can be used without an additional statistical software and  even new solutions of disclosure control and anonymization techniques  can be integrated.",

The service will then be  developed to incorporate information from the UK 1971, 1981, 1991 and  2011 censuses, as well as other, non-census datasets. Further research  will create new metadata on geographic and definitional comparability to  enable integrated use of these datasets.

                    "abstract": "Governments mandate their National Statistics Offices to collect  empirical data to determine appropriate policies. Re-use of this data  for research can provide input regarding the effectiveness of government  action. In Western Europe and North America policies and institutions  support the efficient collection and sharing of official data for  research purposes. In Africa the sharing of government microdata is  constrained by several obstacles. African National Statistics Offices  have limited resources to curate microdata and ensure its long-term  availability. Consequently many African data producers do not follow  international best practice with regard to survey data management or  share the microdata from the surveys they conduct. This was confirmed by  a survey conducted in order to investigate the availability of survey  microdata from African National Statistics Offices for research. A  further obstacle to access to government microdata in Africa is  inadequate producer-user communication channels. Concerns around the  confidentiality of respondent information also present a barrier to data  usage for research, as does the bureaucratic nature of government  institutions involved in data production in African countries. Access to  official microdata for research requires sound data usage policies  driven by African decision-makers who appreciate the role of information  utilisation in national development.",

In the UK  such conditions have become more commonplace with the growth of special  licences and securing settings for government microdata. In order to  assess the potential impact of these conditions on the usability of  data, a survey was conducted to obtain data from a representative sample  UK social scientists in ten disciplines to better understand their  working environments and practices during the autumn of 2009. A 61%  response rate was achieved resulting in over six hundred completed  questionnaires. The survey covered a range of questions which included,  access to computing facilities, including data and printout storage,  home working, data transportation, awareness of institutional policies  on personal data, and attitudes to a range of access conditions.",

                    "abstract": "Access to restricted microdata for research is increasingly part of the  data dissemination strategy within countries, made possible by  improvements in technology and changes in the risk-benefit perceptions  of NSIs. For international data sharing, relatively little progress has  been made. Recent developments in Germany, the Netherlands and the US  are notable as exceptions. This paper argues that the situation is made  more complex by the lack of a general coherent risk-assessment  framework. Discussions about whether something should be done become  sidetracked into discussions about how procedural issues would constrain  implementation. International data sharing negotiations quickly become  bilateral, often dataset-specific, and of limited general value. One way  forward is to decouple implementation from principles. A  principles-based risk-assessment framework could be designed to address  the multiple-component data security models which are increasingly seen  as best practice. Such a framework allows decisions a out access to  focus on legal-procedural issues; similarly, secure facilities could be  developed to standards independent of dataset-specific negotiations. In  an international context, proposals for classification systems are  easier to agree than specific multilateral implementations. The paper  concludes with examples from the UK and cross-European projects to show  how such principles-based standards could work in practice.",

In  addition to informing about the ethical norms that relate to data  archiving, Arja will tell how the Finnish Social Science Data Archive  has been involved in making guidelines for ethics review at the  University of Tampere.   \tThe second panelist, Robert Downs, will present on the  perspective that the IRB takes on data management when reviewing  research protocols for the protection of human subjects and discuss ways  in which these issues can be addressed.  He will also discuss some  challenges that the protection of human subjects presents to researchers  and archives for the collection, management, and dissemination of data.   \tThe third panelist, Yasamin Miller, will speak on the current  state of ethics review and how it should and will change in the future.   Yasamin will also provide perspectives, concerns, ideas, etc. from the  human subjects review board/IRB side of the table.",

Its operation is legally framed  by the 2007 statistics Act. A key problem in Secure Data Service (SDS)  data confidentiality is to balance the legitimate requirements of data  users and confidentiality protection. Employing security technologies  used by the military and banking sectors, the SDS will allow trained  researchers to remotely access data which is held securely on central  SDS servers at the UK Data Archive. The aim of the service is to provide  approved academics unprecedented access to valuable data for research  from their home institutions, with all of the necessary safeguards to  ensure that data is held, accessed and handled securely. The SDS follows  a model which suggests that the safe use of data should cover the  elements of safe project, safe people, safe setting and safe output. In  order to achieve the above goal, data security depends on a matrix of  factors, including technical, legal, contractual, and educational.",

                    "abstract": "The 1999 census was the last exhaustive census in France that has moved  towards a continuous population census since 2006. At that time, the  French national statistical office (INSEE) renewed profoundly his  website and propose today several collections of aggregated tables, at  municipality level, and more than 10 different microdata files. Anybody  can now download these tables and files without any commitment and free  of charge. Yet the on-line microdata files are not complete due to  confidentiality protection requirements and the standard aggregated  tables cannot answer all the questions. The presentation will focus on  the evolution of the specific role of the French Data Archives in this  new context. The Centre Maurice Halbwachs (CMH), who is in charge within  R\u00e9seau Quetelet to provide access to government micro data for the  researchers, offers in cooperation with INSEE specific ways for  tabulations on request. It also provides the annual census survey micro  data file. The new remote access built by INSEE in cooperation with the  Data Archives will offer other possibilities. Finally, not surprisingly,  researchers also continue to turn to CMH for getting help and advice.",

One of the priorities of the project is to explore how new,  collaborative, web-based technologies have influenced teaching and  learning of spatial concepts and dissemination and use of spatial data.  We then intend to incorporate these tools into the Geospatial Portal,  thus encouraging its integration into fundamental classroom and research  processes. In this presentation, we will provide an engaging and fun  look at the latest online technologies for sharing, creating, and  working with spatial data, with visual examples of projects featuring  mashups, collaboration tools, and community-contributed data.

The tool used to  deliver it - Casweb - was once-upon-a-time innovative. Unfortunately  this is no longer the case. The tool 'does the job' but users (say they)  are looking for more interactivity, improved ease of use, and better  ways to combine data. Achieving this is not easy given a small team  whose remit is to support tens of thousands of users, as well as keeping  up with changing user expectations and undertaking in-house  development. And all this when the data delivery methods are changing  too. Still, never ones to turn down a challenge, the team at Manchester  has undertaken to update the data access system in-line with user  requirements. A separate paper discusses the underpinning technology  (the InFuse project based on SDMX and a data feed approach). This  paper/presentation shows how we are engaging directly with users - both  face to face and using social software - to get them to tell us what  they really really want.",

The  University of North Carolina at Charlotte has embarked on a  ethnographically-based study of student use of the library that includes  hiring an Anthropologist to facilitate helping librarians better  understand student behavior. This study is in the early stages but is  patterned after study at the University of Rochester. M presentation  will focus on how the library plans to incorporate this study and the  changes it suggests into an overall re-design of library websites and  the physical facility itself with the goal of better serving the  students.

Following some high\n profile data disclosure scandals and fearing public and respondent \nbacklash, many data providers are seeking to place even greater \nrestrictions on research access to detailed data. How can research \naccess to data be preserved (and indeed expanded) whilst ensuring data \nsecurity? This panel will compare and contrast existing options across \nthe globe for providing secure access to sensitive data. Participants \nwill include Tim Mulcahy/Pascal Heus from the NORC Secure Data Enclave \n(representing direct secure remote access to microdata), Stefan Bender \nfrom the German IAB (representing a remote execution service), a \nrepresentative TBC from the Canadian Research Data Centres (representing\n networked safe centres), and a representative TBC from the US Census \nRDCs (representing stand-alone secure centres).

                    "abstract": "The study of the network structure of academic disciplines through the  analysis of publication citation data has a long history in the field of  social network analysis (eg. Mullins et al, 1977). Such studies have  examined network characteristics such as the centrality of researchers  within collaborative networks (Bollen et al, 2005), and the  characteristics distinguishing core and peripheral members of networks  (Borgatti and Everett, 1999). The prevalence of such research can in  part be attributed to the relatively easy collection of the relational  data required for social network analysis, in a consistent and  structured form, within a definable population. It is therefore somewhat  surprising that the holdings of data archives have not been subject to  similar analysis. The metadata describing social science data deposits  represents a rich source of data to explore the emergence of the data  networks supporting social science research activity. This paper seeks  to address therefore seeks to fill this gap. It presents a longitudinal  social network analysis of the data holdings of the Australian Social  Science Data Archive, exploring the patterns of deposit by discipline  and institution, over the 30 year history of the archive, as well as  visualisation of the emergence of the deposit network over time.",

To  undertake the research, the authors match an explicit measure of  institutional IT adoption (domain names, e.g. www.umsl.edu) with  institutional data on all published papers indexed by ISI for 1,348  four-year colleges, universities and medical schools for the years  1991-2007. The publication data cover the social sciences, humanities,  and natural sciences and narrower fields such as economics and biology.  Three measures of co-authorship are examined: (1) average number of  coauthors by institution; (2) percent of papers from an institution with  one or more co-authors at another U.S. institution; and (3) percent of  papers with one or more non-U.S. coauthors. The study describes  collaboration patterns and then uses regression analysis to examine the  impact of IT \u201cexposure\u201d on co-authorship. Preliminary results suggest:  1) dramatic growth in co-authorship within and across fields; and; 2)  differential effects of IT by field.",

The phenomena in focus or the project parameters  will definitely vary in their intensities in different contexts. So  knowledge or patterns developed at one site will need validation and  further enrichment by examining the same at multiple sites. Hence for  effective synthesis of knowledge about any phenomena, it is essential to  have international collaboration along with multi-site research.  Further knowledge is discovered from the databases. Hence, a different  perspective and different analysis to the same database will definitely  lead to discovery of new knowledge body. Hence it is not only essential  that the knowledge discovered is preserved but also the underlying data.  The data can be essentially configured to the needs of new research  projects. This paper tries to provide insights on how Social networking  can be effectively used to identify potential collaborators in research,  resolves issues in multisite-research, knowledge re-use and data  configuration management.",

                    "abstract": "The Data-PASS partnership engages in collaboration at three levels: coordinated operations, development of best practices, and creation and use of open-source shared infrastructure. The first talk in the session provides an update on our search for replication and distributed storage technologies for preservation. Systems like iRODS and LOCKSS can be developed into preservation environments for social science data archives. The key when implementing these preservation environments will be the modification of existing archive policies and procedures to reflect new dependence on collaboration. The second talk discusses the collection of international public opinion data collected by the USIA, which began in 1952 and extended through 1999. Until recently, these data were difficult to access. The Roper Center and the National Archives and Records Administration have identified, rescued, and made these data available to the research community. The third talk describes a new alliance between ICPSR and Institutional Repositories (IRs) with the goal of preserving and re-using social science data. This talk focuses on the formation of these partnerships; how an archiving guide for IRs will be developed; and new services that ICPSR can offer to IRs to assist with social science data. The fourth talk summarizes the efforts of ICPSR and the Roper Center to migrate punched card data to modern preservation formats. This presentation focuses on the recovery of the Cornell Retirement Study, a longitudinal study that began in 1952. The final talk discusses the current collaborative structure of Data-PASS, our agreements, infrastructure, and the services and infrastructure available to new partners.",

This presentation will discuss 3  projects: (1) e-Legacy, an NHPRC-funded project which is developing  preservation infrastructure and services for state government geospatial  data, (2) PoDRI, an IMLS-funded project which explores policy-based  interoperability between Fedora and iRODS repositories, and (3) T-RACES  (Testbed for the Redlining Archives of California's Exclusionary  Spaces), an IMLS-funded project which builds on these other projects and  will publish an online archive of historical redlining and racial  discrimination data. T-RACES documents the New Deal Home Owners' Loan  Corporation federal agency's confidential security maps and surveys of  the 1930s. These surveys form the genesis of neighborhood discrimination  and restricted mortgage lending, known as redlining. A digital library  interface based on interactive databases and Google Map and Google Earth  interfaces will integrate data from 8 California cities, including Los  Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland. The intent of this archive is to  serve as a core reference data set that can be augmented and customized  through social networking mechanisms, through overlays of social science  data.  Across all three projects, the authors are interested in roles  and responsibilities of data services and data repositories that support  concepts of policies and customization.",

We had been studying and developing tools to systematically  document the larger contexts in which archival materials are located, to  understand the cultural informatics of meaning and how it is ascribed  both by the archivists and users of records. This paper examines the use  of two tools we use (the Online Heritage Resource Manager \u2013 OHRM, and  the Heritage Documentation Management System \u2013 HDMS) while working  directly social science researchers and their data. In particular it  explores metadata interchange with DDI (Versions 2 and 3) and the  positioning of these tools within the Open Archive Information System  reference model. The systematic documentation of contexts (there are  often more than one) has numerous benefits but for social science data  it is probably the management of rich and highly interconnected  authority records where the most obvious benefit lies. The paper will  conclude with reference to recent work on the development and  utilisation of the Encoded Archival Context xml schema.",
