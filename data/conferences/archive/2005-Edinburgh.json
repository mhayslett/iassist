The focus will be on survey-data (also complex  hierarchical studies) as well aggregated data or cubes. Even publishing  of maps (GIS-resources), reports and other documents will be covered.  The workshop is a follow-up to workshop 4, but can also be useful for  persons without prior knowledge of Nesstar. The workshop will be  hands-on and participants are encouraged to bring their own data.",

                    "abstract": "In the past few years new streaming geospatial data sources have become  available, allowing users and their applications to interact with remote  geospatial data resources and services.  These services are based on  proprietary technologies such as ESRI\u2019s \u2018image server\u2019 and \u2018feature  server\u2019 as well on open technologies such as the Open Geospatial  Consortium specifications. The most common examples of the latter  include WMS (\u2018Web Map Service\u2019) and WFS (\u2018Web Feature Service\u2019)  specifications although other specifications are being published and  used such as Web Coverage Service (WCS) and the Catalog Interface (CAT).   This workshop will focus on consumption of such data sources and  services, with an eye to integrating these new resources with more  traditional file-based data offerings.  Topics to be addressed include: demystifying the alphabet soup of  WMS, WFS, WCS, GML, etc.; identifying and evaluating some existing  streaming data sources; discussing the advantages and pitfalls of using  streaming data in project work and research; and highlighting challenges  related to integration of streaming data with traditional file-based  data in catalogs and metadata databases.  The discussion will include hands-on examination of some existing  streaming geospatial data services.  While the workshop will primarily  focus on consumption of such services, a brief overview of approaches to  publishing streaming data will also be provided and the issues arising  from doing so.   Also to be considered is the challenge posed to data  preservation by the elimination of data file acquisition as a necessary  precursor to providing data access.",

This workshop will begin with a brief introduction  to DDI and XML and then move on to a hands-on exercise in which  participants create DDI codebooks from actual documents they have  brought from their local settings. The bulk of the session will be  hands-on entry by participants, resulting in a DDI-compliant file that  can be taken home. Freely-roaming instructors will be available  throughout the hands-on portion of the workshop to answer questions and  offer advice, and DDI questions at any level of expertise are  encouraged! The workshop will conclude with suggestions on how to markup  documents more efficiently as well as a look toward what is coming with  DDI 3.0.  You might consider taking this workshop if:  you are new to the DDI and would benefit from an overview of the basicsyou have questions about how to mark up documentation from your local collectionyou have questions about how to more efficiently mark up documentsyou are wondering where the DDI is going with version 3.0 and what that means for DDI documentation created in an earlier version  For this session, participants should bring a codebook file in MSWord or ASCII on a CD or USB flash drive.  Participants are also encouraged to bring a paper copy of their codebook, in case of technical difficulties on the morning of the workshop.",

                    "abstract": "The eight Millennium Development Goals and eighteen  targets were adopted by consensus at the United Nations Millennnium  Summit of the General Assembly in 2000. In just a few years, they have  become the strategic centerpiece of international development assistance  and support to the world's poor countries, and the measure of  differences between the poor and the rich. The goals and targets were  specified to a considerable extent in quantifiable terms and reflected  recommendations from the previous decade of global conferences on  environment, status of women, social development, population and  development,education for all and international finance, among others.  In adopting the Declaration the General Assembly also asked the  Secretary-General to set up an evidence-based system  to monitor  progress towards achievement of the goals and targets at national,  regional and international levels, through an annual global report and  an extensive network of national reports. At the regional and  international levels, these and related reports are based on data at the  United Nations Statistics Division's Millennium Indicators Database at  http://millenniumindicators.un.org.                                                 The proposed presentation would take a few of these indicators--such as  extreme poverty, gender parity in school, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS  and atmospheric C02--and demonstrate, preferably online if a connection  is available, how the data can be retrieved from the database and  interpreted. The emphasis will be, through specific examples, on how to  get maximum information from limited data without taking the data beyond  the serious limitations of reliability and availability typical of  international statistics. Researchers should approach the data with a  healthy skepticism and be prepared to look further to understand their  sources, methods and limitations. The more they know about the data, the  better they can put together their research strategy and the better and  more reliable their  hypotheses and conclusions will be.",

                    "abstract": "The United Nations publish unemployment statistics  for 123 countries.  Most of these statistics are based on International  Labour Office (ILO) criteria for the definition of unemployment, but  many countries also produce unemployment statistics based on insurance  records and on the basis of registered unemployment.  The paper aims to compare the main features of different series.  The  dimensions compared include the conceptual basis for the definition of  unemployment, use of denominators for production of unemployment rates,  boundaries with employment and inactivity, entry statistics and duration  of unemployment, and the cultural influence of the statistics.  The paper identifies conflicts between achieving international  comparability and national needs.  Survey statistics that underpin  international comparisons do not support geographically detailed  analysis within countries.  The value of ILO statistics also is limited  by failure to recognise the concept of entry to unemployment and  difficulties of integration with other unemployment statistics.  The  standard LFS questionnaire could be modified to support the production  of statistics for entrants to unemployment.  The sampling frame could be  modified to ensure consistency with nationally produced insurance or  registered unemployment statistics.

ESDS International provides  academics across the UK with access to the major international databanks  produced by international governmental agencies such as the United  Nations, International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  In this paper we  describe how an emerging new user community for these databanks has been  developed and supported, and the challenges of responding to a diverse  and expanding user group.  We report some of the problems users face  accessing and using the data in their teaching and research and how  these barriers can be overcome.  Finally, we examine how the rapid  growth in usage in the UK is reflected in current global trends and the  potential demand for access to these databanks worldwide.",

These two organisations are founded and funded on very different principles and scales, and are looking at related problems from different angles; nevertheless, they aim to complement and mutually support each other.

Although the effort will focus  solely on North Carolina, it is expected to serve as a demonstration  project for other states.  Targeted resources include digitized maps,  geographic information systems (GIS) data sets, and remote sensing data  resources such as digital aerial photography.  State and local agencies  frequently offer more detailed and up-to-date geospatial data than  federal agencies. However, these entities are by definition  decentralized, and their dissemination practices focus almost  exclusively on providing access to the most current data available,  rather than any older versions.  The project partners will develop a  digital repository architecture for geospatial data through use of open  source software tools such as DSpace and emerging metadata standards  such as Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS). In addition,  the partners will investigate application of emerging Open Geospatial  Consortium specifications for data interoperability in the archive  development process.  Specific technical and organizational challenges  will be discussed.",

We elaborate the issue by answering most questions outlined in the  session abstract, especially from the point of view of a new archive. A  good working strategy for safeguarding sufficient flow of data requires  investments in general promotion of comparative and secondary research,  and a lot of encouragement of researchers to leave their data in  archive.   We discuss the methods to acquire data sets that are used most  frequently, and what type of data has been used the least. Also, we try  to classify the types of action needed to ensure success in getting the  data in, and keeping both researchers and data providers pleased. In  addition, the presentation discusses briefly how the science funding  organizations have acknowledged the need to support acquisition of the  national data archives in Europe.",

Both the UK Data Archive and ICPSR have a 35+ year history during which both have seen a number of changes in their acquisitions policies and in the way in which data are acquired. In the first part of the paper, the experiences of ICPSR's recent phased policy revision in 2004-2005 is described that has resulted in a new policy approved by eminent social scientists and archivists from around the world.   In the second part, the paper sets out the UKDAs' work to revise its Collections Development Policy to encompass the needs of the distributed national data service, the Economic and Social Data Service. UKDA are also now working closely with the national Research Councils to operate, more efficiently, official datasets policies both for Research Programmes and Research Grants.  Work from a recent project that is supporting data creation and data management for a high investment cross-disciplinary thematic research programme that is generating some interesting yet complex data is highlighted. Both Data Archives describe their internal strategies and procedures that have been used to review existing policies and identify current best practices, trends and developments, with a view to reworking their own policies.  They pay attention to detailing the internal processes that include setting up new procedures and groups to assess, oversee and monitor potential and incoming national and international data sources.

                    "abstract": "Modernization in Asia has created the urgent need  for reliable data about socio-economic developments in each country and  region.  Although statistical agencies, IGOs and NGOs have commissioned  numerous surveys about living standards, public opinion and social  behavior across the continent, much of the data collected have not been  made public, or are only accessible to a select few.  Where data files  are available, onerous access conditions make accessibility difficult.   Even NGO- or IGO-funded surveys are not usually made public or deposited  in an accessible data archive. Based in part on field research in  Vietnam in 2004 as a Fulbright research scholar, the author, a social  science data librarian, surveys the state of social science archiving  primarily in Vietnam and the prospects for encouraging and  institutionalizing data sharing.  This paper addresses various possible  solutions to this problem of data sharing and the implications for  social science research.",

Consequently, the demand for  socio-economic data for designing, targeting, and monitoring development  policies and programs has been constantly growing. Considerable  investments have been made in developing countries to collect data. But  the return on these investments is far from optimal. National data  producers often have weak analytical capacity, and access to survey  datasets by secondary users is limited due to political, legal and  technical constraints. Most datasets are inadequately preserved,  documented and disseminated, and remain under-exploited.                                            To foster better use of existing data by promoting the adoption of  international standards and best practice of data preservation,  documentation and dissemination, the World Bank and the International  Household Survey Network  are developing guidelines and tools (such as the DDI-based Data  Dissemination Toolkit) and are providing technical and financial  assistance in data archiving to statistics producers in developing  countries.   The paper will present the background and rationale of these activities,  and describe how the tools being developed and new partnerships with  the dataarchive and research community in developed countries could  contribute to better development results.",

DevInfo is a database system endorsed by the UN system that can help realize this vision. It  is a general purpose database system designed for the collation,  dissemination and presentation of human development indicators.  The  technology has been specifically designed to support governments in MDG  monitoring.  In addition, the system can be adapted to include  additional user-defined indicators linked to national monitoring  frameworks. By serving as a common database, DevInfo can be used to add  value to national statistics systems by complementing existing databases  and bridging data dissemination gaps.   DevInfo presents data in  tables, graphs and maps to help countries report on the status of the  MDGs and to advocate for their achievement through evidence-based policy  development.",

Never the less, use and usability of offered  services is changing with new technologies and that is why practice,  that was once very good, needs to be changing as well. Regular users of  data archive services have different needs than new users. Decision was  made to interview both groups of users to find out first how to improve  ADP work and services provided (e.g. improving accessibility of  information on a web page) and second, to find out for what purposes are  data and documentation mostly used - to find the most common user group  to target. At the same time we provided information about services that  ADP offers and metadata information about surveys that are available.  Our experience is that part of provided information is rarely used,  because users had no knowledge of its existence or practicability.  Gathered information will be used to help plan future services and to  prepare seminars for target groups.",

The reality is that training for  data professionals in universities is limited, poeple change jobs (and  thus leave vacanies)and career paths entirely in the data sphere are  limited.  This session will describe Canada's national training and  mentoring process and will give an example of students are trained to  become part of a team that that offers a full range of data services.   This is the process by which the expertise required to staff Canada's 67  data centres is being developed.",

As a field-building enterprise, CPANDA seeks  not only to archive relevant data sets, but also to spur new research,  encourage emerging scholars to take an interest in the field, and inform  journalists, policy makers, artists, cultural organizations, and the  public about the data it collects.                       Meeting the needs of such a diverse set of potential users poses  significant challenges for organizing and creating web content, building  tools for accessing data, and educating non-researchers on the proper  interpretation of statistical data.  At the same time, CPANDA must also  meet the needs of its primary constituency, the research community; it  is, after all, a data archive.  This presentation will discuss how  CPANDA structures users' online experience so as to meet the data and  information needs of individuals with widely differing backgrounds and  research expertise.",

In the spring of 2005, Duke's Social Science Research  Institute in collaboration with Duke Libraries conducted a joint survey  of Social Science faculty and graduate students to determine 1.) the  usage of data/statistical services on campus 2.) the level of awareness  of data resources/statistical computing on campus and 3.) the need for  additional data resources.  Additionally, the survey attempted to  determine the level/need for statistical training on campus.  This  presentation (and paper) provides a summary of our survey's findings and  an analysis of the implications for data and statistical services at  Duke and other research institutions. ",

Lack of management  understanding about the nature and contributions of data libraries and  their staff may result in difficulties in acquiring necessary resources.

Examples are drawn from both the library and advocacy  literature and will propose strategies for getting on the  administration\u2019s agenda.

SNS has developed a wide range of socio-economic data sets  on a new consistent statistical geography called data zones. SNS is being used to inform the Executive's approach to improving the  quality of life for people living in Scotland and especially in the most  disadvantaged areas.  The information is invaluable to Community Planning Partnerships (there  are 32  such partnerships across Scotland) where the availability of  quality information is crucial to the way in which services are  developed and delivered and issues of local concern are addressed. The presentation will cover background, data development, use of data  and geography in policy, particularly illustrated by the Scottish Index  of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2004.    ",

The Economic Research Service (ERS), collaborating with the  National Agricultural and Statistics Service, two Agencies of the United  States Federal Government, has attempted to respond to increasing  demand for access to this data.  However, the survey is conducted under a  pledge of confidentiality that allows use of the data only for the  purpose of statistical analysis.  This raises significant barriers to  allowing remote access to the ARMS data.  Presented with this conflict,  ERS sought to use new technologies to enable the Agency to provide  easier access to the data while ensuring its confidentiality.  The  restricted access extranet application that the ARMS team developed was  deployed in September, 2004, and a public version of the tool was  deployed less than a month later.  This paper will describe both the  tool and the process by which it was successfully developed.",

The base units of analysis are lower level Super Output Areas (SOAs) that are relatively consistent in terms of population size and allow the release of socio-economic data unavailable at smaller output area levels. Other advantages include boundary stability over time and the ability to nest SOAs within key administrative boundaries.  SOAs are, however, specifically designed for social census data. Environmental data are more often collected in 1km or 100km grid squares or at points. This paper concerns the challenges arising from the integration of data from the social and natural sciences. Problems of boundary intersections, scale effects, geographic and statistical errors, data holes and the implications of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) for the resulting dataset are discussed in detail and the importance of metadata for the rural typologies is outlined.",

There are an equal number of obstacles to capturing metadata,  including time and cost constraints, the complexity of  computer assisted survey systems and instruments, and the  lack of adequate tools for documenting the survey life cycle.  ISR at the University of Michigan and ZUMA have collaborated  on the development of a web-based Survey Metadata Documentation  System (SMDS) designed to facilitate documentation of a  survey's lifecycle, from initial design through data collection,  and post-survey processing and archiving.  This paper will  describe the design and structure of SMDS, which has eleven  data entry modules.  Modules can be completed in any order  and by multiple users, allowing the person most knowledgable  about each particular phase of the survey to enter the data.  The use of such systems to standardize metadata capture and  develop comparative survey documentation (across countries,  languages, survey waves, etc.) will be discussed.                     ",

During the stages from  identification of a data gap through to data analysis and  interpretation, large surveys generate many different products relating  to the design, data capture, and processing of the data.  Training  manuals, for example, provide information on the conduct of an  interviewer and, in some cases, that knowledge is critical to the  interpretation of the survey results.  Reports with recommendations  arising from the field testing of survey methodologies and instruments  highlight limitations of a survey methodology in more detail than are  normally present in the user manual.  Using the examples of recent  Statistics Canada surveys, such as the National Population                      Health Survey and the Canadian Community Health Survey, this paper will  examine some of the products of the data life course.  In archiving,  documenting, and using survey data, IASSIST members should be searching  out these products to permit a more meaningful understanding of the  data.",

The web based, bilingual (French and English) application allows staff members working with economic and financial data to easily determine what statistical data are available, to acquire information about these data such as their sources and to locate specific data objects (time series, formulas). The repository facilitates the re-use and sharing of statistical data resources by also capturing information on corporate applications and projects that use and create statistical data.  This paper describes the reasons for the creation of the repository, the challenges experienced and overcome, the lessons learned and the rewards since implementation. ",

With the wholesale migration of  government information to digitized formats, the information is now far  more readily available and, indeed, far more of it is available.   Additionally the globalization of government information provides more  detailed data but complicates the choices facing researchers.                                            This paper looks at the type of information that supports e-government  and its place in academic research.  The difficulties of using the  information, though, have not gone away and for some types new  challenges have emerged.  This summary examines the impact of the web on  government information, traces recent developments and predicts future  trends.",

This paper will firstly examine the rise of Healthcare Networks from the  French perspective and will compare that with experiences in United  States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Spain in a background of  management of the complexity (global vision both of the networked  organisation and of the  patients).    Secondly the paper will outline specific aspects of Health data:  personal, sensitive, confidential and conforming to particular  legislation. Then the paper will study their use both for the monitoring  of patients\u2019 pathways and for the management of organisations with the  essential role of Information and Communication Systems (information  sharing and quality of data) with their key element: the patient\u2019s  Electronic Health Record. Finally the paper will demonstrate how  supportive evaluation of these community service organisations helps  develop their collective identity via a process of continuous  improvement.",

                    "abstract": "For nearly three decades  information technologists and democracy theorists have contended that  the digital revolution would renew and invigorate political community.  The early utopian cyberdemocrats were optimistic that information and  communication technologies (ICTs) would provide a vehicle for effective  political participation in the public sphere, by diffusing and improving  access to and use of information for public decision making. Employing  theoretical frameworks from information science and political science on  information and political behavior and democratic theory, this paper  examines the claims of the cyberdemocrats as they relate to the search  for political information through the Internet. The analysis relies on a  series of national surveys of the U.S. population conducted by the Pew  Internet Life Project between 2000 and 2004. The results indicate that,  in general, the Internet has had little effect on increasing the  salience of politics for most people but provides an additional channel  of information for people who are already active seekers of political  information.

Last November NIWI and Statistics Netherlands were proud to present a second round of preliminary results during a special meeting at which the new website was presented. Work on the census digitization will continue throughout 2005 and (hopefully) finish at the end of this year. In this paper I would like to address three topics concerning our work on the digitization of census material;  The new website contains not just data, but also metadata and background material. I will give a quick tour of our new website (www.volkstelling.nl, which by May will also be available in English).  Work on an online Historical GIS is progressing. We hope to have a data mapping server up this year in which to present our census data. I will give an update on our efforts toward a Historical GIS.  In 2005 our work will mainly focus on the documentation of the censuses. I will address our efforts to document and harmonize the census data. ",

This is  reducing the value of these important data resources for secondary and  comparative analysis. The latest version of the Nesstar Publisher has  been designed to meet the requirements of large and complex surveys  allowing data producers and archives to document and preserve the  complete set of artefacts from a data gathering project and to publish  these collections on CDrom or to a Nesstar server.

The system  also provides extensive support for distributed collections and  federated  networks. The long-term goal of the VDC project is to increase the  replicability of research by providing advanced tools to support  exchange,  citation, and preservation of research data.   \"The DataWeb\" (http://www.theDataWeb.org) is a network of government and  non-profit statistical databases with associated data access and  manipulation tools. This system, developed by the U.S. Census Bureau  with support from other federal agencies, provides free server and  analytical software to agencies and organizations that want to  participate in the policy oriented data Other planned future releases of  the VDC will include, among many other features, extended support for  \"deep citations\" of data subsets, support for extended data analyses,  and support for operation of the VDC on other platforms.   This briefing will outline a cooperative effort, aimed at enabling these  systems to interoperate -- with a view to giving the user communities  associated with each system integrated access to data and resources  available within both networks: By having both systems installed on one  host, one can provide access to a common data store via either network.  In addition, the two systems will locate and exchange data within a  federated environment using open standards including DDI, OAI, and open  XSL-based metadata crosswalks.",

The  common goal of these schemes is to enable organisations to rely on  digital credentials issued by partner organisations even if partners  deploy different authentication technologies (such as passwords or  digital certificates). When a user requests access to a protected  resource, the user is redirected to their home institution where an  authentication exchange takes place. If successful, the user is  redirected back to the resource along with a set of security assertions  signed by the home institution.                                            Within the UK, the focus of interest is the Shibboleth model, developed  by the Internet2 Middleware Architecture Committee for Education (MACE).  A strategic decision has been made to adopt Shibboleth as the preferred  solution for identity management for services in the JISC Information  Environment, and for use in other contexts, including e-Science. The  immediate issues are the development of trust relationships within and  between federations, and to assure interoperability and widespread  deployment.",

The UK Data Archive (UKDA) is  the central registration hub within a dispersed network of eight,  UK-based, digital data resource targets.  As such, it requires  target-to-target communication in order to apply the user\u2019s registration  credentials to each resource, thus removing the need for the user to  register with each separately or to agree more than once to any special  data-related conditions.                                           This paper will describe the preliminary work being  undertaken, via the \u2018shibbolisation\u2019 of three resources, to place this  registration system within a federated model of access control.  It will  also describe the target-to-target communication required and the  suggested Shibboleth-enhanced registration model which could be rolled  out to all eight resources.  It will identify initial issues discovered  by the team and compare the proposed model with other access management  schemes.",

Societies face two primary challenges in order to respond to  this need for timely information \u2013 access to relevant data and a corps  of qualified researchers to conduct the analyses. As part of a response  to the challenges that confront Canadian policy research, a network of  Research Data Centres was formally launched in December 2000 with the  opening of the centre at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. There  are currently 13 Research Data Centres located throughout the country,  so researchers are not obliged to travel to Ottawa to access Statistics  Canada data. At the same time, the centres are administered in  accordance with all the confidentiality rules required under the  Statistics Act. The Research Data Centres meet, in a single location,  both the need to facilitate access to detailed micro-data for crucial  social research and the need to protect the confidentiality and security  of Canadians\u2019 information. The research conducted in the centres  generates a wide perspective on Canada's social landscape. The network  expands the collaboration between Statistics Canada, the Social Sciences  and Humanities Research Council, universities and academic researchers,  and it builds on the Data Liberation Initiative  (http://www.statcan.ca/english/Dli/dli.htm). It also is instrumental in  training a new generation of Canadian quantitative social scientists. ",

The mid 1980s saw the emergence of Edinburgh University Data Library  and Oxford Data Library (Nuffield College), and more recently the London  School of Economics (LSE) Data Library and the LSE Research Laboratory  Data Service. Based at tertiary education institutions these specialised  libraries have evolved independently to assist researchers and teachers  in the use of quantitative data for analysis and research purposes.  Thus whether by design or accident the data librarian was born in the  UK. In this digital age with increased IT literacy, technological  exposure and expectancy the data librarian\u2019s role is ever more confusing  and difficult to identify.  This paper will discuss the differing areas  of expertise within the UK data libraries, the role of the Data  Information Specialists Committee \u2013 UK (DISC-UK), in addition to the  role played by other information staff which identify them as potential  or \u2018accidental\u2019 data librarians from \u2018non-data library\u2019 institutions.",

Recent discussions about how one becomes a \u201cdata  librarian\u201d show that there is no single route to becoming one.  But, is  the data profession just data librarians?  Is it even a profession?  In  this presentation, I plan to investigate what a \u201cprofession\u201d is, using  some of the many definitions that have been proposed.  I will apply  these definitions and characteristics to explore whether or not \u201cData\u201d  is a profession.   Finally, I will propose some avenues by which we can  strengthen the professional qualities of \u201cData.\u201d",

Among them, a greater respect for the  diversity of information, particularly data, produced and distributed by  the federal government sector; an appreciation for Title 44 of the U.S.  Code and its impact on information accessibility; and the challenges  and opportunities for converting U.S. Government Information into an  electronic, networked environment. Learning, from the 'documents' side,  more about the federal government's nature and structure, new and  traditional distribution channels, and nature of information available;  have all improved the provision of data services to patrons.",

NAICS aims at nothing less than  capturing and measuring the information economy. While the change  represents an important improvement over the previous system, it also  illustrates the difficulty of organizing and aggregating data intended  to describe a dynamic economy. To illustrate this issue we look at the  ways in which an increasingly significant element of the economy, open  source-based software production, is not really depicted or even  depictable in NAICS. We argue that the underlying values embedded in  NAICS leave no room for novel features of the new economy, such as  production practices that interact with traditional forms of economic  exchange but are not subject to its rules.",

It dates back to the idea  of the Enlightenment that careful description of natural species,  formations of clouds, the population etc. could give an insight that was  worth getting.   The paper will outline the history of the social survey starting from  the studies of the poor in the UK carried out by philanthropists up till  the social surveys carried out continuously in the modern welfare  state. One aspect of this history is the formation of data archives in a  wide range of nation states around the world since the 1960s. The data  archives were given the obligation of storing and distributing social  survey data sets, as governments acknowledged the great scientific value  of social survey data sets.   In many respects, to tell the history of the social survey is to tell  the history of the development of the modern welfare state. The argument  of the paper will be that the two have walked hand in hand. As we  debate the challenges, limitations, and responsibilities of the welfare  state so we as data archivists must be aware of the challenges,  limitations, and responsibilities of the social survey as a tool for  public administration and social science.

                    "abstract": " When setting out to assess  'the quantum of happiness' in the late 18th Century, Sir John Sinclair,  child of the Scottish Enlightenment and the first Secretary of the  (British) Board of Agriculture, was the first to use the term statistics  in its modern sense. His survey of 166 queries to each of the church  ministers in the 938 parishes resulted in two Statistical Accounts of  Scotland. The first covered the 1790s and the second ('New') covered  1830s; together they represent the best contemporary 'repeat survey' of  life at the beginning of the first industrial nation: topics include  wealth, class and poverty, climate, agriculture, fishing and wildlife;  population, schools, and the moral health of the people. With the  formation of the British State underway, the contrast in the  presentation of numerical information in text and as tables in the two  Accounts serves as a reminder that Sinclair can be credited with the  foundations of the 'Blue Book' and of the tradition of 'official  statistics' adopted widely today.   Just over two hundred years later, in 1996, Henry Heaney (former  Librarian of the University of Glasgow) secured support to fund a  digitisation plan to protect the relatively rare and fragile volumes of  the Statistical Accounts, which had become regarded as a key resource,  and agreement that EDINA set up means to access the scanned pages. There  followed subsequent keying of text, experimentation with cross-sectoral  'ownership', with name entity extraction from text and use of GIS, as  well as focus on maintaining and developing access to a 'national  treasure'. A revision of the user interface to a service, accessed by  scholars, genealogists and the Scottish Diaspora world-wide, will be  available as part of the presentation.   ",

For those who sought a way of producing machine processable  codebooks, it is a dream come true.  For those who were searching for a  data/survey preservation format, it seems to be an answer.  But like all  standards, it must have tools that support it and expanding user  acceptance in order to survive and thrive.  Some tools (such as   NESSTAR) have been built to embrace DDI and others have been adapted to  read DDI files. But is this enough for the DDI to survive, or better  yet, thrive?  Is there scope for applying these tools and standards  beyond the data library/archives community?

The Scheme's aim is to  develop and promote innovative methodological approaches to the  archiving, sharing, re-use and secondary analysis of qualitative  research and data, and that means thinking beyond the traditional  centralised data archive model (ie ESDS Qualidata).  The ESDS Qualidata  project is exploring methodological and technical solutions for exposing  digital qualitative data to make them fully shareable and exploitable.   The project deals with specifying and testing non-proprietary means of  storing and marking-up data using universal (XML) standards and  technologies, and proposes an XML community standard (schema) that will  be applicable to most qualitative data.  The second strand investigates  optimal requirements for contextualising research data (e.g. interview  setting or interviewer characteristics), aiming to develop standards for  data documentation and ways of capturing this information.  The third  strand aims to use natural language processing technology to develop and  implement user-friendly tools for semi-automating processes to prepare  qualitative data for both traditional digital archiving and to enable  more adventurous collaborative research and e-science type exploitation,  like linking multiple data and information sources. The project aims to  further research tools for publishing (e.g. for web interrogation) and  archiving enriched marked-up data and associated research materials.",

The use of data and its interpretation has not been exploited  in today\u2019s curriculum and has resulted in many students lacking the  basic know-how when it comes to data use and interpretation.  At the  University of Guelph, the history and economics departments offer a  course entitled \u201cHistory by Numbers\u201d, with the goal of introducing  fourth year history students to quantitative data sources and to basic  statistical concepts.                                           This paper will discuss how students used the  Nesstar WebView to access the 1871 Canadian Census data for an  assignment, how they found navigating through the Census variables  relatively easy and how some were easily frustrated when asked to create  cross-tabulations and to interpret their findings.  Despite the  difficulties encountered by some, by the end of the semester there were  several students who \u201cdiscovered the world of data\u201d and continue to use  it to enhance their research papers and theses.

Given the  interdisciplinary nature of data, involving them in providing data  services provides an opportunity to leverage their expertise and reach a  broader base of potential users.                Thus, the MIT Data Services Librarian initiated a project to train subject librarians on data services so that they could:  - provide improved data reference service,  - refer users to related campus resources,  - improve coverage of data in their instruction sessions, and  - discuss with their departmental faculty the Libraries' projects regarding data collections and services for data producers.   The presenter will discuss the development and implementation of the  program, plans for ongoing training, and suggestions for involving  subject librarians at other universities.",

A major focus was on explaining  terminology and discussing the differences between different broad types  of data - macro and micro, time series, cross-sectional and panel,  media opinion polls and academic social surveys.  We discussed how to  recognize which type of data a patron needs, and gave pointers to major  sources for each kind.

While  critical steps have been successfully implemented on the study and file  levels, much more could be done on the variable level to fully realize  the research potential of these data resources. As a step toward this  end, the Roper Center is working with ABC News and the Washington Post  to produce fully documented data files for many polls conducted from  1979 to 1997.               The metadata and system file generation project will seek to build  upon the iPOLL question-level database by extending it to better  reflect elements of the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). The  resulting variable-level metadata can then be used to create DDI-based  XML files, SPSS syntax and system files. This presentation will describe  the scope and requirements of the project, mapping of iPOLL database  fields to DDI variable elements (Section 4), and the user interface for  project and metadata management. Finally, an update on progress and a  review of the potential for generalized utility of the system and  lessons learned will be addressed.                                    ",

It began to be compiled in 1997 after the Institute won  competitive research and development funding from the Hungarian state.  There is a constant need for photographic illustrations for the  Institute\u2019s printed and digital publications. Initially, digital photos  were simply archived on cd-rom, with attached text files containing  descriptions of them. Once a large number of photos connected with  post-Second World War Hungarian history had accumulated, it was seen  that storage in a database would facilitate repeated use of them.                           Only the descriptions were included in the database at first,  while the digitalized, high-resolution files and associated thumbnails  were stored in a separate cd-rom library. The photo descriptions began  to be made available on the Internet in 1998. Although the user  interface operated in a rather cumbersome way, there was quite a large  demand from schools, public institutions and the press, mainly on the  occasion of various national commemorations.  (http://www.rev.hu/foto/plsql/foto_1a_www_e$.startup)               For the Oral History Project presented at the 2004 IASSIST  conference, the structure of the database was transformed and integrated  into the contemporary history database, so that photo documents would  be incorporated in a direct and uniform way into all the Internet  projects the Institute is preparing.  (http://server2001.rev.hu/oha/index.html)               On the structure of the photo archiving and photo database in the  presentation, I would like to mention the following issues and problems:         1. Technical issues concerning digitalization of the photo documents (resolution, file format, data storage).        2. Problems relating to collection, archiving and provision of the  photo documents and copyright issues. Expansion of the work of  collecting photo documents.        3. Description of the photo documents in the light of international standards and recommendations.        4. A short presentation of the database (structure, how photos are  linked to other documents, events, persons etc.) Making the database  multilingual. Search facilities and other demands.        5. Experience at the Institute with using the database.",

                    "abstract": "This paper reports on  ASPECT (http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/aspect/), an initiative which  addresses both the public\u2019s need for ready access to empirical data and  ephemeral information associated with Scottish parliamentary elections,  and the scholarly community\u2019s need for continuing access to and  preservation of such data and information.                   ASPECT has created a digital archive of electoral ephemera,  together with detailed election results and statistics, from the 1999  and 2003 Scottish parliamentary elections. In the second phase of  development, the digital archive will be extended to incorporate party  election broadcasts, hustings, media interviews and news reports. The  aim is to support both participative democracy in Scotland and  retrospective analysis by the scholarly community; initial usage  statistics suggest that ASPECT is already attracting a diverse range of  users.               The data covers not only the historic election of the first  Scottish parliament for 300 years, but also the subsequent election in  which the Scottish political context moved from a four-party to a  six-party structure. The data provides unparalleled insight into the  ways in which politicians\u2019 discourse addresses the need to construct  party identity in this more complex context and reflects Scotland\u2019s  multiple identities as a distinctive nation within the UK and the EU.",

From guided queries to batch  download capabilities, users are able to specify which series, date  range and format they\u2019d like for their download. The data are modeled in  XML using the SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) standard  developed by a consortium of international agencies. Data modeled in XML  using this new standard can be easily served up in a variety of  formats, including XML, which will facilitate data exchange with other  organizations that use the standard. We have developed a system, which  will be demonstrated, that meets the current user needs and yet  positions us for Web services and other technologies on the horizon.",

This data set is unique in that it integrates traditional social  science data, population data derived from national census counts, with  administrative and boundary data to produce a new data product with many  interdisciplinary applications. Data file inputs number in the  thousands and the output data set files and documentation number in the  hundreds. The volume of these data presents unique data management and  documentation issues above and beyond the usual technical issues related  to the methodology behind the production of the integrated data  product. This paper will present lessons learned from developing GPW v3,  as well as implications of these lessons for end-users of the data.  These issues gained increased salience in light of the use of GPW v3,  and related data products, in response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean  tsunami.",

This paper focuses  on our implementation of the DDI Aggregate Data Extension, fundamental  to the system's internal operation: data are all held in one column of  one database table and must be assigned to an nCube to be mapped or  graphed. Some extensions reflect the particular application: the  definition of themes and rates as additional entities. Others may be of  more general applicability: defining universes and measurement units as  entities, not attributes. Holding data in Oracle means the data map  holds \"cell references\", not physical locations. Our metadata has to  organise data from multiple censuses to chart change over time, making  metadata authoring an act of interpretation.",

                    "abstract": "The data infrastructure in Central and Eastern  Europe: Current situation and prospects It took about two decades to  implement the idea of data archives in western Europe. When the first  European data archives were founded in the sixties, social sciences were  considered data poor and an infrastructure for social research was  weak. As regards Eastern Europe on the one hand we are facing similar  problems, but on the other hand there are completely new preconditions  for setting up a data archive. New technologies and the World Wide Web  have opened up undreamed-of possibilities for creating a social data  archive. Additionally, the new archives can take advantage of the  experience and support of the well established data archives. This  presentation will describe the development of data services for social  sciences in the East European countries and it will discuss the need of  creating special networks and experts groups to concentrate the efforts  in the field of the development of archive tools and meta data  production. It will introduce the activities of the East European Data  Archive Network (EDAN). Larisa Kosova from the Russian Data Archive  (RSDA) and Janez Stebe from the Slovenian Archive (ADP) will report on  their experiences and new challenges. ",

Since then  very little has transpired to improve the use of citations even though  statistics and data today has become more complex with the variety of  data formats available. It is time to resume the discussion.                           This paper explores the challenge for IASSIST and IFDO in  developing and promoting a culture of citing statistics and data.  Existing practices will be discussed as well as the link between  metadata and citation i.e. Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) to Data  Citation Initiative (DCI). The characteristics of proper citation will  be noted including the benefits of full and consistent citations to  users, data producers and data distributors. Lastly, an exciting new web  tool for citing statistics and data, available through the Data  Liberation Initiative (DLI) in Canada, will be demonstrated.",

Available at local,  regional and federal levels budget data composes a research base for  investigations and a decision support holding for powers. It is also  vital for citizens and public initiatives. Given that budget statistics  in Russia is the most accurately gathered and regularly updated stuff of  all other state data it is a social challenge to implement an  information system integrating local, regional and federal statistics  and government agencies reports, think tanks publications and academic  papers on state finances and compliment it with developed  subject-oriented search instrument. An information system on budget data  is implemented and updated as part of the University Information System  RUSSIA (www.cir.ru/www.budgetrf.ru). The most ambitious part of the  product is a System of Subject Headings for Russian Federation Budget  Data processing and integration. The System of Subject Headings will be  also used as a search instrument to navigate in Russian Federation  Budget Data. As a first step a RF state finances ontology was formed. A  beta version consisted of 100+ categories, it was presented for  evaluation to a group of specialists in the field. The comments were  gathered and discussed. By collective efforts a SSH final version was  composed. The work has started on each category terminological  presentation/description/support. Terminology is borrowed from the UIS  RUSSIA thesaurus (70000+ descriptors and terms). As a next step a  SSH-thesaurus (120 categories, 5000+ descriptors with terms) will be  created and tested while processing the budget data and documents.  Specialists engaged in the project will evaluate the results to provide  for a tool horning. The instrument created will be implemented to search  across an integrated holding of the RF budget data and documents  investigating the finance situation and system analysis of economic and  social processes.

                    "abstract": "Within the past five years, the Grid has evolved  from its beginnings as a highly specialised research tool to its  adoption as the blueprint for a new kind of global computing  infrastructure. This has seen Grid computing being taken up by a wider  research community and the emergence of new forms of research practice  now encapsulated within the notion of \u2018e-Science\u2019.                           Grids come in a variety of forms: computational grids, data grids,  access grids and sensor grids. This paper examines the possible forms  and potential impact of sensor grids for social science research.               The value of sensor grids stems from the way they enable  researchers to manage remote data gathering via distributed networks of  instruments. Examples of sensor grids in scientific research include  networks of environmental monitoring devices. Analogously, the notion of  sensor grids for social science research envisages harnessing the  progressive \u2018instrumentation\u2019 of the social world through, for example,  CCTV, mobile phones and ubiquitous computing devices: digital data about  social phenomena is being generated on ever increasing scale as a by  product of the everyday activities of social actors and could provide a  richer picture of social phenomena than is available through more  conventional data gathering techniques.               The paper will discuss possible research applications for social  science sensor grids, including the real-time analysis of social  patterns and processes, and issues for their practical realisation,  including data integration and management, and ethical issues relating  to access, security, confidentiality and privacy.",

All other survey designs are in fact reductions or  simplifications of that model. The overarching objectives are to  develop standards to describe as well as tools to produce and to manage  related metadata. The scope of information the project has to deal with  is metadata according to the general definition of the Data  Documentation Initiative (DDI): \"Metadata (data about data) constitute  the information that enables the effective, efficient, and accurate use  of those datasets\". All developments are based on the analysis of all  phases of a study life-cycle. Based on this analysis the conceptual and  relational data models for MetaDater were developed.                   As agreed, the results of the model development and user analyses  were provided to DDI-Alliance, which will take up the life cycle model.  Currently the style sheets and functionalities for the data  documentation by data collectors and providers are being developed.  First user test will start in June 2005.               MetaDater is designed to improve interoperability of social  science data bases for comparative research and will thus contribute to  the emerging social science data GRID.",

                    "abstract": "The conceptual metadata model must meet two main requirements:        a. Support the needs for data storing of the metadata management system        b. If the data model is implemented in a relational database it must be possible to be used by other applications.               Thus, the conceptual metadata model will support the functionality  of the whole research product life cycle. If we try to model the whole  research procedure we need a conceptual model of the whole system. We  must differentiate between the conceptual model of the system and the  conceptual metadata model, because the term 'conceptual' is misleading.  The metadata management system will automate specific parts of the  conceptual model of the system.               We distinguish metadata entities in five categories:        * The first category consists of the entities that describe  autonomous documents produced in the context of a study at study level  documentation (i.e. documents that are produced in the context of a  specific study, and can be also used independently of the study). We  will call these entities documentation objects.        * The second category consists of the entities that describe  autonomous objects produced in the context of a study at variable level  documentation.        * The third category consists of the entities that describe  objects that depend on another object and that cannot be disseminated  autonomously.        * The fourth category consists of the entities that describe  administrational characteristics of specific documentation objects, or  of the entire system.        * The fifth category consists of the entities that describe  objects that are produced and used in the context of a metadata  management system and not in the context of a study: the study  description, the dataset description, the questionnaire, the project  description, the file descriptions and the references to publications.               The entities in this category have some common administrational  characteristics, which are expressed in the conceptual data model as  'subtypes' of a 'supertype', table which is called \"Documentation  objects\".

                    "abstract": "For a long time, the data  documentation standards have been limited to the description of  cross-section studies. To some extent, this documentation schema can  also be used for cross-national studies, as far as the latter take the  form of a well known integrated dataset. The increasing importance of  some cross-national projects in the last twenty years or so  (Eurobarometer, ISSP, ESS etc.) raises nevertheless new expectations.  The DDI-Alliance has created a special expert group to handle those  questions. The CSDI (Comparative Survey Design and Implementation  Network) works on quality standards for cross-national studies, of which  detailed documentation is an important component.                                            For the EU funded MetaDater project, working on a metadata management  and production system, the repeated cross-national study was selected as  the highest complexity to be handled in the data model and the  application. The following questions must be answered in this  perspective:       * Is the ambition to describe with more appropriate categories the  well known integrated data file or to document each of the country  specific datasets?          * If one chooses to document the single components of the  cross-national study, a new question raises: how will the whole set of  single cross-sections be described? Defining the whole as a 'collection'  of cross-sections can do it; a more promising way would consist in  relating organically questions and variables in those datasets, which  are related over space or through time.           If this network of relationships between questions, resp. variables, is  established carefully, it can be used to support the process of  integration of country specific datasets. At the end of the process, the  questions and variables in the integrated dataset are related to the  questions and variables in the integrated national cross-sections. This  information can be fed into any standard publication of the metadata for  the whole project, making it possible to navigate through the whole  project. ",

Existing information systems, used for primary  production, data preservation and dissemination, cannot support the  functionality of a GRID because the data models used in the three  working phases do communicate badly.

In elaborating on these themes, this paper will look at Statistics  Canada\u2019s ongoing redesign of its public good products, its use of  usability testing and its active engagement of the business, educational  and media communities to encourage statistical literacy and research.  The paper will also examine some of the challenges facing public good  statistics, such as meeting the needs of diverse publics and archiving  dynamic publications.",

National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA) offers access to records to anyone who seeks to  have access, subject to the terms of the federal Freedom of Information  Act . Throughout the 35 years of NARA\u2019s custodial program for electronic  records, academic researchers have acquired copies of more archival  digital data files than has any other researcher group. New knowledge,  new research techniques, new understanding of historical phenomena have  emerged from researcher use of NARA\u2019s archival electronic records. Some  research has influenced social policy, some has answered questions about  the nature of war casualties, while other research has informed our  common understanding of ourselves and our nation. International scholars  have used U.S. archival digital data to study the opinions of their  countrymen on a wide-variety of issues posed to them by an agency of the  U.S. government, collected by that agency for its own programmatic  purposes.                   The proposed paper analyzes research use of archival data and is  based upon administrative data from the most recent years of an archival  reference program for electronic records at the U.S. National Archives  and Records Administration. Both traditional and online forms of access  to digital data will be discussed and the impact of offering multiple  forms of access will be explored.",

                    "abstract": "The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has initiated  the FRASER (Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research)  project, and is also adding a new historical component to FRED, called  ALFRED. FRASER is an image archive of historic economic data  publications which allows for sophisticated retrieval of statistical  tables over many years. ALFRED is an automated system that will allow  researchers to retrieve historical real-time economic data series.  ALFRED is slated to go live in mid-2005. Initially histories will be  available for about 25 data series, with more to be added in the future.                    These two new tools will allow researchers to access economic data  as it was presented at a moment in time, and with each correction and  update. For many researchers, it important to analyze data as it was  available\u2014rather than the perfected data released much later. Important  policy decisions are made with this imperfect data\u2014and determining the  problems of that data as well as its usefulness is key to developing  good models. For the casual user, it can provide information about  economic conditions at a specific place and time. A significant feature  of the FRED archive retrieval system is the option to enter both a date  range (earliest and latest desired material) and a calendar \"as-of\"  date. The presentation will discuss these two tools, their development,  and their use.               The presentation will also discuss the problems/issues of the  na\u00efve user. They may copy tables that have been OCRed, but the OCR has  not been verified. We have decided to impose a burden on our users\u2014we  require that they register and sign an agreement, stating that they  recognize the limitations of the OCR process. In particular, uncorrected  OCR tables make it difficult to spot errors. Correcting the OCR is  expensive. We plan to evaluate the use of the material, and correct the  OCR if the use warrants it. ",

Major cross-sectional datasets collected on behalf of central government and are routinely  made available to secondary analysis via the UK Data Archive at the  University of Essex, supported by the Government surveys group of the  Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS Government) led by the Cathie Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Research at the University of Manchester.  The data include a wide range of specialist surveys collected principally reasons of policy development and monitoring.  The surveys are continuous, large-scale and cross-sectional.  The portfolio includes surveys such as the General Household Survey, Labour Force Survey, British Crime Survey, Health Survey for England, Expediture and Food Survey, Family Resources Survey, British Social Attitudes Survey and national variants.  Many of these have surveys have been running for decades providing considerable scope for assessing social change.  This paper reviews the way in which these datasets are currently being used by the UK academic community and highlights the research potential offered by these important and highly flexible resources.  The paper will also explain the way in which recent and future developments in dissemination and value added materials for users enable facilitate increased use of the data.
